Syria (ISIS /ˈaɪsɪs/),[66] officially as the Islamic State (IS) and by its Arabic language acronym Daesh (Arabic: داعش‎, translit. dāʿish, IPA: [ˈdaːʕɪʃ]),[67][68] is a Salafi jihadist militant group and former unrecognised proto-state[69] that follows a fundamentalist, Salafi doctrine of Sunni Islam.[70][71] ISIL gained global prominence in early 2014 when it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in its Western Iraq offensive,[72] followed by its capture of Mosul[73] and the Sinjar massacre.[74]\n", "The group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and many individual countries. ISIL is widely known for its videos of beheadings and other types of executions[75] of both soldiers and civilians, including journalists and aid workers, and its destruction of cultural heritage sites.[76] The United Nations holds ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes. ISIL also committed ethnic cleansing on an historic scale in northern Iraq.[77]\n", "ISIL originated as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda and participated in the Iraqi insurgency following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces at the behest of the United States. In June 2014 the group proclaimed itself a worldwide caliphate[78][79] and began referring to itself as the Islamic State (الدولة الإسلامية ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah; IS)[80]. As a caliphate, it claimed religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide.[81] Its adoption of the name Islamic State and its idea of a caliphate have been widely criticised, with the United Nations, various governments and mainstream Muslim groups rejecting its statehood.[82]\n", "In Syria, the group conducted ground attacks on both government forces and opposition factions and by December 2015 it held a large area in western Iraq and eastern Syria, containing an estimated 2.8 to 8 million people,[83][84] where it enforced its interpretation of sharia law. ISIL is believed to be operational in 18 countries across the world, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, with \"aspiring branches\" in Mali, Egypt, Somalia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines.[85][86][87][88] In 2015, ISIL was estimated to have an annual budget of more than US$1 billion and a force of more than 30,000 fighters.[89]\n", "In July 2017, the group lost control of its largest city, Mosul, to the Iraqi army.[90] Following this major defeat, ISIL continued to lose territory to the various states and other military forces allied against it, until it controlled no meaningful territory by November 2017.[91] U.S. military officials and simultaneous military analyses reported in December 2017 that the group retained a mere 2 percent of the territory they had previously held.[92] On 10 December 2017, Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that Iraqi forces had driven the last remnants of Islamic State from the country, three years after the militant group captured about a third of Iraq's territory.[93] By 23 March 2019, ISIL lost their final pieces of controlled territory, surrendering their \"tent city\" and pockets in Al-Baghuz Fawqani near the end of the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani.[43]\n", "In April 2013, having expanded into Syria, the group adopted the name ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām (الدولة الإسلامية في العراق والشام‎). As al-Shām is a region often compared with the Levant or Greater Syria, the group's name has been variously translated as \"Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham\",[94] \"Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\"[95] (both abbreviated as ISIS), or \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\" (abbreviated as ISIL).[66]\n", "While the use of either one or the other acronym has been the subject of debate,[66][96] the distinction between the two and its relevance has been considered not so great.[66] Of greater relevance is the name Daesh, which is an acronym of ISIL's Arabic name al-Dawlah al-Islamīyah fī l-ʻIrāq wa-sh-Shām. Dāʿish (داعش‎), or Daesh. This name has been widely used by ISIL's Arabic-speaking detractors,[clarification needed][97][98] although – and to a certain extent because – it is considered derogatory, as it resembles the Arabic words Daes (\"one who crushes, or tramples down, something underfoot\") and Dāhis (loosely translated: \"one who sows discord\").[67][99] Within areas under its control, ISIL considers use of the name Daesh punishable by flogging[100] or cutting out the tongue.[101]\n", "In late June 2014, the group renamed itself ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah (lit. Islamic State or IS), declaring itself a worldwide caliphate.[79] The name \"Islamic State\" and the group's claim to be a caliphate have been widely rejected, with the UN, various governments, and mainstream Muslim groups refusing to use the new name.[102][103] The group's declaration of a new caliphate in June 2014 and its adoption of the name \"Islamic State\" have been criticised and ridiculed by Muslim scholars and rival Islamists both inside and outside the territory it controls.[102][104]\n", "In a speech in September 2014, United States President Barack Obama said that ISIL was neither \"Islamic\" (on the basis that no religion condones the killing of innocents) nor was it a \"state\" (in that no government recognises the group as a state),[105] while many object to using the name \"Islamic State\" owing to the far-reaching religious and political claims to authority which that name implies. The United Nations Security Council,[106] the United States,[105] Canada,[107] Turkey,[108] Australia,[109] Russia,[110] the United Kingdom[111] and other countries generally call the group \"ISIL\", while much of the Arab world uses the Arabic acronym \"Dāʻish\" (or \"Daesh\"). France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said \"This is a terrorist group and not a state. I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims, and Islamists. The Arabs call it 'Daesh' and I will be calling them the 'Daesh cutthroats.'\"[112] Retired general John Allen, the U.S. envoy appointed to co-ordinate the coalition; U.S. Army Lieutenant General James Terry, head of operations against the group; and Secretary of State John Kerry had all shifted towards use of the term Daesh by December 2014.[113]\n", "ISIL is a theocracy, proto-state[114][115][116] and a Salafi or Wahhabi group.[12][117][118] ISIL's ideology represents radical Salafi Islam, a strict, puritanical form of Sunni Islam.[119] Muslim organisations like Islamic Networks Group (ING) in America have argued against this interpretation of Islam.[120] ISIS promotes religious violence, and regards Muslims who do not agree with its interpretations as infidels or apostates.[9] According to Hayder al Khoei, ISIL's philosophy is represented by the symbolism in the Black Standard variant of the legendary battle flag of Muhammad that it has adopted: the flag shows the Seal of Muhammad within a white circle, with the phrase above it, \"There is no god but Allah\".[121] Such symbolism has been said to point to ISIL's belief that it represents the restoration of the caliphate of early Islam, with all the political, religious and eschatological ramifications that this would imply.[122]\n", "ISIS adheres to global jihadist principles and follows the hard-line ideology of al-Qaeda and many other modern-day jihadist groups,[4][9] which is closely related to Wahhabism.\n", "For their guiding principles, the leaders of the Islamic State ... are open and clear about their almost exclusive commitment to the Wahhabi movement of Sunni Islam. The group circulates images of Wahhabi religious textbooks from Saudi Arabia in the schools it controls. Videos from the group's territory have shown Wahhabi texts plastered on the sides of an official missionary van.", "According to The Economist, dissidents in the former ISIL capital of Raqqa report that \"all 12 of the judges who now run its court system ... are Saudis\". Saudi practices also followed by the group include the establishment of religious police to root out \"vice\" and enforce attendance at salat prayers, the widespread use of capital punishment, and the destruction or re-purposing of any non-Sunni religious buildings.[124] Bernard Haykel has described ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's creed as \"a kind of untamed Wahhabism\".[123] Senior Saudi religious leaders have issued statements condemning ISIL[125] and attempting to distance the group from official Saudi religious beliefs.[126]\n", "ISIL aims to return to the early days of Islam, rejecting all innovations in the religion, which it believes corrupts its original spirit. It condemns later caliphates and the Ottoman Empire for deviating from what it calls pure Islam, and seeks to revive the original Wahhabi project of the restoration of the caliphate governed by strict Salafist doctrine. Following Salafi-Wahhabi tradition, ISIL condemns the followers of secular law as disbelievers, putting the current Saudi Arabian government in that category.[70]\n", "Salafists such as ISIL believe that only a legitimate authority can undertake the leadership of jihad, and that the first priority over other areas of combat, such as fighting non-Muslim countries, is the purification of Islamic society. For example, ISIL regards the Palestinian Sunni group Hamas as apostates who have no legitimate authority to lead jihad and see fighting Hamas as the first step toward confrontation by ISIL with Israel.[123][127]\n", "One difference between ISIL and other Islamist and jihadist movements, including al-Qaeda, is the group's emphasis on eschatology and apocalypticism – that is, a belief in a final Day of Judgment by God, and specifically, a belief that the arrival of one known as Imam Mahdi is near. ISIL believes that it will defeat the army of \"Rome\" at the town of Dabiq, in fulfilment of prophecy.[128] Following its interpretation of the Hadith of the Twelve Successors, ISIL also believes that after al-Baghdadi there will be only four more legitimate caliphs.[128]\n", "The noted scholar of militant Islamism Will McCants writes:\n", "References to the End Times fill Islamic State propaganda. It's a big selling point with foreign fighters, who want to travel to the lands where the final battles of the apocalypse will take place. The civil wars raging in those countries today [Iraq and Syria] lend credibility to the prophecies. The Islamic State has stoked the apocalyptic fire. [...] For Bin Laden's generation, the apocalypse wasn't a great recruiting pitch. Governments in the Middle East two decades ago were more stable, and sectarianism was more subdued. It was better to recruit by calling to arms against corruption and tyranny than against the Antichrist. Today, though, the apocalyptic recruiting pitch makes more sense than before.", "Since at latest 2004, a significant goal of the group has been the foundation of a Sunni Islamic state.[130][131] Specifically, ISIL has sought to establish itself as a caliphate, an Islamic state led by a group of religious authorities under a supreme leader – the caliph – who is believed to be the successor to Prophet Muhammad.[132] In June 2014, ISIL published a document in which it claimed to have traced the lineage of its leader al-Baghdadi back to Muhammad,[132] and upon proclaiming a new caliphate on 29 June, the group appointed al-Baghdadi as its caliph. As caliph, he demands the allegiance of all devout Muslims worldwide, according to Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh).[133]\n", "ISIL has detailed its goals in its Dabiq magazine, saying it will continue to seize land and take over the entire Earth until its:\n", "Blessed flag...covers all eastern and western extents of the Earth, filling the world with the truth and justice of Islam and putting an end to the falsehood and tyranny of jahiliyyah [state of ignorance], even if America and its coalition despise such.", "According to German journalist Jürgen Todenhöfer, who spent ten days embedded with ISIL in Mosul, the view he kept hearing was that ISIL wants to \"conquer the world\", and that all who do not believe in the group's interpretation of the Quran will be killed. Todenhöfer was struck by the ISIL fighters' belief that \"all religions who agree with democracy have to die\",[135] and by their \"incredible enthusiasm\" – including enthusiasm for killing \"hundreds of millions\" of people.[136]\n", "When the caliphate was proclaimed, ISIL stated: \"The legality of all emirates, groups, states and organisations becomes null by the expansion of the khilafah's [caliphate's] authority and arrival of its troops to their areas.\"[132] This was a rejection of the political divisions in Southwestern Asia that were established by the UK and France during World War I in the Sykes–Picot Agreement.[137][138][139]\n", "All non-Muslim areas would be targeted for conquest after the Muslim lands were dealt with, according to the Islamist manual Management of Savagery.[140][141][142]\n", "Documents found after the death of Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, a former colonel in the intelligence service of the Iraqi Air Force before the US invasion who had been described as \"the strategic head\" of ISIL, detailed planning for the ISIL takeover of northern Syria which made possible \"the group's later advances into Iraq\". Al-Khlifawi called for the infiltration of areas to be conquered with spies who would find out \"as much as possible about the target towns: Who lived there, who was in charge, which families were religious, which Islamic school of religious jurisprudence they belonged to, how many mosques there were, who the imam was, how many wives and children he had and how old they were\". Following this surveillance and espionage would come murder and kidnapping – \"the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent\". In Raqqa, after rebel forces drove out the Assad regime and ISIL infiltrated the town, \"first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared\".[143]\n", "Security and intelligence expert Martin Reardon has described ISIL's purpose as being to psychologically \"break\" those under its control, \"[...] so as to ensure their absolute allegiance through fear and intimidation,\" while generating, \"[...]outright hate and vengeance\" among its enemies.[144] Jason Burke, a journalist writing on Salafi jihadism, has written that ISIL's goal is to \"terrorize, mobilize [and] polarize\".[145][146] Its efforts to terrorise are intended to intimidate civilian populations and force governments of the target enemy \"to make rash decisions that they otherwise would not choose\". It aims to mobilise its supporters by motivating them with, for example, spectacular deadly attacks deep in Western territory (such as the November 2015 Paris attacks), to polarise by driving Muslim populations – particularly in the West – away from their governments, thus increasing the appeal of ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate among them, and to: \"Eliminate neutral parties through either absorption or elimination\".[145][147] Journalist Rukmini Maria Callimachi also emphasises ISIL's interest in polarization or in eliminating what it calls the \"grey zone\" between the black (non-Muslims) and white (ISIL). \"The gray is moderate Muslims who are living in the West and are happy and feel engaged in the society here.\"[148]\n", "A work published online in 2004 entitled Management of Savagery[149] (Idarat at Tawahoush), described by several media outlets as influential on ISIL[150][151][152] and intended to provide a strategy to create a new Islamic caliphate,[153] recommended a strategy of attack outside its territory in which fighters would, \"Diversify and widen the vexation strikes against the Crusader-Zionist enemy in every place in the Islamic world, and even outside of it if possible, so as to disperse the efforts of the alliance of the enemy and thus drain it to the greatest extent possible.\"[154]\n", "The group has been accused of attempting to \"bolster morale\" and distract attention from its loss of territory to enemies by staging terror attacks abroad (such as the 6 June 2017 attacks on Tehran, the 22 May 2017 bombing in Manchester, UK, and the 3 June 2017 attacks in London that ISIL claimed credit for).[155]\n", "Raqqa in Syria was under ISIL control since 2013 and in 2014 it became the group's de facto capital city.[156] On 17 October 2017, following a lengthy battle that saw massive destruction to the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced the full capture of Raqqa from ISIL.\n", "ISIL is headed and run by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State's self-styled Caliph. Before their deaths, he had two deputy leaders, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani for Iraq and Abu Ali al-Anbari (also known as Abu Ala al-Afri)[157] for Syria, both ethnic Turkmen. Advising al-Baghdadi is a cabinet of senior leaders, while its operations in Iraq and Syria are controlled by local 'emirs,' who head semi-autonomous groups which the Islamic State refers to as its provinces.[158][159] Beneath the leaders are councils on finance, leadership, military matters, legal matters (including decisions on executions) foreign fighters' assistance, security, intelligence and media. In addition, a shura council has the task of ensuring that all decisions made by the governors and councils comply with the group's interpretation of sharia.[160] While al-Baghdadi has told followers to \"advise me when I err\" in sermons, according to observers \"any threat, opposition, or even contradiction is instantly eradicated\".[161]\n", "According to Iraqis, Syrians and analysts who study the group, almost all of ISIL's leaders—including the members of its military and security committees and the majority of its emirs and princes—are former Iraqi military and intelligence officers, specifically former members of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath government who lost their jobs and pensions in the de-Ba'athification process after that regime was overthrown.[165][166][167][168] The former Chief Strategist in the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism of the US State Department, David Kilcullen, has said that \"There undeniably would be no Isis if we had not invaded Iraq.\"[169]\nIt has been reported that Iraqis and Syrians have been given greater precedence over other nationalities within ISIL because the group needs the loyalties of the local Sunni populations in both Syria and Iraq in order to be sustainable.[170][171] Other reports, however, have indicated that Syrians are at a disadvantage to foreign members, with some native Syrian fighters resenting \"favouritism\" allegedly shown towards foreigners over pay and accommodation.[172][173]\n", "In August 2016, media reports based on briefings by Western intelligence agencies suggested that ISIL had a multilevel secret service known in Arabic as Emni, established in 2014, that has become a combination of an internal police force and an external operations directorate complete with regional branches. The unit was believed to be under the overall command of ISIL's most senior Syrian operative, spokesman and propaganda chief Abu Mohammad al-Adnani[174][175] until his death by airstrike in late August 2016.[20]\n", "\n", "In 2014 The Wall Street Journal estimated that eight million people lived in the Islamic State.[176] The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has stated that ISIL \"seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey\".[177] Civilians, as well as the Islamic State itself, have released footage of some of the human rights abuses.[178][179]\n", "Social control of civilians is by imposition of ISIL's reading of sharia law,[180] enforced by morality police forces known as Al-Hisbah and the all-women Al-Khanssaa Brigade, a general police force, courts, and other entities managing recruitment, tribal relations, and education.[177] Al-Hisbah is led by Abu Muhammad al-Jazrawi.[181]\n", "Estimates of the size of ISIL's military have varied widely, from tens of thousands[183] up to 200,000.[44]\nIn early 2015, journalist Mary Anne Weaver estimated that half of ISIL fighters were foreigners.[184] A UN report estimated a total of 15,000 fighters from over 80 countries were in ISIL's ranks in November 2014.[185] US intelligence estimated an increase to around 20,000 foreign fighters in February 2015, including 3,400 from the Western world.[186] In September 2015, the CIA estimated that 30,000 foreign fighters had joined ISIL.[187]\n", "According to Abu Hajjar, a former senior leader of ISIL, foreign fighters receive food, petrol and housing, but unlike native Iraqi or Syrian fighters, they do not receive payment in wages.[188] Since 2012, more than 3000 people from the central Asian countries have gone to Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan to join the Islamic State, ISIS or Jabhat al Nusra.[189]\n", "\n", "ISIL relies mostly on captured weapons with major sources including Saddam Hussein's Iraqi stockpiles from the 2003–11 Iraq insurgency[190] and weapons from government and opposition forces fighting in the Syrian Civil War and during the post-US withdrawal Iraqi insurgency. The captured weapons, including armour, guns, surface-to-air missiles, and even some aircraft, enabled rapid territorial growth and facilitated the capture of additional equipment.[191] For example, ISIL captured US-made TOW anti-tank missiles supplied by the United States and Saudi Arabia to the Free Syrian Army in Syria.[192][193] Ninety percent of the group's weapons ultimately originated in China, Russia or Eastern Europe according to Conflict Armament Research.[194]\n", "The group uses truck and car bombs, suicide bombers and IEDs, and has used chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria.[195] ISIL captured nuclear materials from Mosul University in July 2014, but is unlikely to be able to convert them into weapons.[196][197]\nIn September 2015 a US official stated that ISIL was manufacturing and using mustard agent in Syria and Iraq, and had an active chemical weapons research team.[198][199] ISIL has also used water as a weapon of war. The group closed the gates of the smaller Nuaimiyah dam in Fallujah in April 2014, flooding the surrounding regions, while cutting the water supply to the Shia-dominated south. Around 12,000 families lost their homes and 200 km² of villages and fields were either flooded or dried up. The economy of the region also suffered with destruction of cropland and electricity shortages.[200]\n", "During the Battle of Mosul it was reported that commercially available quadcopters and drones were being used by ISIL as surveillance and weapons delivery platforms using extemporised cradles to drop grenades and other explosives.[201] The ISIL drone facility became a target of Royal Air Force strike aircraft.[202]\n", "Although ISIL attracts followers from different parts of the world by promoting the image of holy war, not all of its recruits end up in combatant roles. There have been several cases of new recruits expecting to be mujahideen who have returned from Syria disappointed by the everyday jobs that were assigned to them, such as drawing water or cleaning toilets, or by the ban imposed on use of mobile phones during military training sessions.[203]\n", "ISIL publishes material directed at women, with media groups encouraging them to play supportive roles within ISIL, such as providing first aid, cooking, nursing and sewing skills, in order to become \"good wives of jihad\".[204] In 2015, it was estimated that western women made up over 550, or 10%, of ISIL's western foreign fighters.[205]\n", "Until 2016, women were generally confined to a \"women's house\" upon arrival which they were unallowed to leave. These houses were often small, dirty and infested with vermin and food supply was scarce. There they remained until they either had found a husband, or the husband they had arrived with had completed his training. After being allowed to leave the confinement, women still generally spent most of their days indoors where their lives are devoted to caring for their husbands and the vast majority of women in the conflict area have children. Mothers play an important role passing on ISIS ideology to their children. Widows are encouraged to remarry.[206]\n", "In a document entitled Women in the Islamic State: Manifesto and Case Study released by the media wing of ISIL's all-female Al-Khanssaa Brigade, emphasis is given to the paramount importance of marriage and motherhood (as early as nine years old). Women should live a life of \"sedentariness\", fulfilling her \"divine duty of motherhood\" at home, with a few exceptions like teachers and doctors.[207][208] Equality for women is opposed, as is education on non-religious subjects, the \"worthless worldly sciences\".[208]\n", "ISIL is known for its extensive and effective use of propaganda.[209][210] It uses a version of the Muslim Black Standard flag and developed an emblem which has clear symbolic meaning in the Muslim world.[121]\n", "In November 2006, shortly after the group's rebranding as the \"Islamic State of Iraq\", it established the Al-Furqan Foundation for Media Production, which produces CDs, DVDs, posters, pamphlets, and web-related propaganda products and official statements.[211] It began to expand its media presence in 2013, with the formation of a second media wing, Al-I'tisam Media Foundation, in March[212][213] and the Ajnad Foundation for Media Production, specialising in nasheeds and audio content, in August.[214] In mid-2014, ISIL established the Al Hayat Media Center, which targets Western audiences and produces material in English, German, Russian and French.[215][216] When ISIL announced its expansion to other countries in November 2014 it established media departments for the new branches, and its media apparatus ensured that the new branches follow the same models it uses in Iraq and Syria.[217] Then FBI Director James Comey said that ISIL's \"propaganda is unusually slick,\" noting that, \"They are broadcasting... in something like 23 languages\".[218]\n", "In July 2014, al-Hayat began publishing a digital magazine called Dabiq, in a number of different languages including English. According to the magazine, its name is taken from the town of Dabiq in northern Syria, which is mentioned in a hadith about Armageddon.[219] Al-Hayat also began publishing other digital magazines, including the Turkish language Konstantiniyye, the Ottoman word for Istanbul,[220][221] and the French language Dar al-Islam.[222] By late 2016, these magazines had apparently all been discontinued, with Al-Hayat's material being consolidated into a new magazine called Rumiyah (Arabic for Rome).[223]\n", "The group also runs a radio network called Al-Bayan, which airs bulletins in Arabic, Russian and English and provides coverage of its activities in Iraq, Syria and Libya.[224]\n", "ISIL's use of social media has been described by one expert as \"probably more sophisticated than [that of] most US companies\".[209][225] It regularly uses social media, particularly Twitter, to distribute its messages.[225][226] The group uses the encrypted instant messaging service Telegram to disseminate images, videos and updates.[227]\n", "The group is known for releasing videos and photographs of executions of prisoners, whether beheadings, shootings, caged prisoners being burnt alive or submerged gradually until drowned.[228] Journalist Abdel Bari Atwan described ISIL's media content as part of a \"systematically applied policy\". The escalating violence of its killings \"guarantees\" the attention of the media and public.[161]\n", "Along with images of brutality, ISIL presents itself as \"an emotionally attractive place where people 'belong', where everyone is a 'brother' or 'sister'\". The \"most potent psychological pitch\" of ISIL media is the promise of heavenly reward to dead jihadist fighters. Frequently posted in their media are dead jihadists' smiling faces, the ISIL 'salute' of a 'right-hand index finger pointing heavenward', and testimonies of happy widows.[161] ISIL has also attempted to present a more \"rational argument\" in a series of videos hosted by the kidnapped journalist John Cantlie. In one video, various current and former US officials were quoted, such as the then US President Barack Obama and former CIA Officer Michael Scheuer.[229]\n", "It has encouraged sympathisers to initiate vehicle-ramming and attacks worldwide.[230]\n", "According to a 2015 study by the Financial Action Task Force, ISIL's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):\n", "Since 2012, ISIL has produced annual reports giving numerical information on its operations, somewhat in the style of corporate reports, seemingly in a bid to encourage potential donors.[209][233]\n", "In 2014, the RAND Corporation analysed ISIL's funding sources from documents captured between 2005 and 2010.[234] It found that outside donations amounted to only 5% of the group's operating budgets,[234] and that cells inside Iraq were required to send up to 20% of the income generated from kidnapping, extortion rackets and other activities to the next level of the group's leadership, which would then redistribute the funds to provincial or local cells that were in difficulties or needed money to conduct attacks.[234] In 2016, RAND estimated that ISIL finances from its largest source of income — oil revenues and the taxes it extracts from people under its control — had fallen from about $1.9 billion in 2014 to $870 million.[235]\n", "In mid-2014, the Iraqi National Intelligence Service obtained information that ISIL had assets worth US$2 billion,[236] making it the richest jihadist group in the world.[237] About three-quarters of this sum was said to looted from Mosul's central bank and commercial banks in the city.[238][239] However, doubt was later cast on whether ISIL was able to retrieve anywhere near that sum from the central bank,[240] and even on whether the looting had actually occurred.[241]\n", "ISIL attempted to create a modern gold dinar by minting gold, silver, and copper coins, based on the coinage used by the Umayyad Caliphate in the 7th century.[242][243][244][245] Despite a propaganda push for the currency, adoption appeared to have been minimal and its internal economy is effectively dollarized, even with regards to its own fines.[246]\n", "Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (1999–2004)\n", "Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (2004–06)\n", "Mujahideen Shura Council (2006)\n", "Islamic State of Iraq (2006–13)\n", "\n", "The group was founded in 1999 by Jordanian Salafi jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi under the name Jamāʻat al-Tawḥīd wa-al-Jihād (lit. \"The Organisation of Monotheism and Jihad\").[51] In a letter published by the Coalition in February 2004, Zarqawi wrote that jihadis should use bombings to start an open sectarian war so that Sunnis from the Islamic world would mobilize against assassinations carried out by Shia, specifically the Badr Brigade, against Ba'athists and Sunnis.[247] Colonel Derek Harvey told Reuters that \"the U.S. military detained Badr assassination teams possessing target lists of Sunni officers and pilots in 2003 and 2004 but did not hold them. Harvey said his superiors told him that 'this stuff had to play itself out' – implying that revenge attacks by returning Shi'ite groups were to be expected.\"[248] Jerry Burke, an adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry, said that in 2005 a plan from him and several colleagues to surveil and stop suspected Badr Brigade death squads in the special police forces was rejected when it got to an American Flag (General) Officer.[249]\n", "Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces, al-Zarqawi and Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad achieved notoriety in the early stages of the Iraqi insurgency for their suicide attacks on Shia mosques, civilians, Iraqi government institutions and Italian soldiers of the US-led 'Multi-National Force'.\n", "\n", "In October 2004, when al-Zarqawi swore loyalty to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, he renamed the group Tanẓīm Qāʻidat al-Jihād fī Bilād al-Rāfidayn (lit. \"The Organisation of Jihad's Base in Mesopotamia\"), commonly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).[2][250][251][252][253] Although the group never called itself al-Qaeda in Iraq, this remained its informal name for many years.[254] Attacks by the group on civilians, Iraqi government forces, foreign diplomats and soldiers, and American convoys continued with roughly the same intensity. In a letter to al-Zarqawi in July 2005, al-Qaeda's then deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri outlined a four-stage plan to expand the Iraq War. The plan included expelling US forces from Iraq, establishing an Islamic authority as a caliphate, spreading the conflict to Iraq's secular neighbours, and clashing with Israel, which the letter said, \"[...] was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity\".[255]\n", "\n", "In January 2006, AQI joined with several smaller Iraqi Sunni insurgent groups under an umbrella organisation called the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC). According to counterterrorism researcher Brian Fishman, the merger was an attempt to give the group a more Iraqi flavour, and perhaps to distance al-Qaeda from some of al-Zarqawi's tactical errors, such as the 2005 bombings by AQI of three hotels in Amman.[256] On 7 June 2006, a US airstrike killed al-Zarqawi, who was succeeded as leader of the group by the Egyptian militant Abu Ayyub al-Masri.[257][258][259]\n", "On 12 October 2006, MSC united with three smaller groups and six Sunni tribes to form the Mutayibeen Coalition, pledging \"To rid Sunnis from the oppression of the rejectionists (Shi'ite Muslims) and the crusader occupiers ... to restore rights even at the price of our own lives ... to make Allah's word supreme in the world, and to restore the glory of Islam\".[260][261] A day later, MSC declared the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), comprising Iraq's six mostly Sunni Arab governorates,[262] with Abu Omar al-Baghdadi its emir[263][264] and al-Masri Minister of War within ISI's ten-member cabinet.[265]\n", "\n", "According to a study compiled by United States intelligence agencies in early 2007, ISI planned to seize power in the central and western areas of Iraq and turn it into a Sunni caliphate.[266]\nThe group built in strength and at its height enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Diyala and Baghdad, claiming Baqubah as a capital city.[267][268][269][270]\n", "The Iraq War troop surge of 2007 supplied the US military with more manpower for operations, and dozens of high-level AQI members being captured or killed.[271] Between July and October 2007, al-Qaeda in Iraq was reported to have lost its secure military bases in Al Anbar province and the Baghdad area.[272] During 2008, a series of US and Iraqi offensives managed to drive out AQI-aligned insurgents from their former safe havens, such as the Diyala and Al Anbar governorates, to the area of the northern city of Mosul.[273]\n", "By 2008, the ISI was describing itself as being in a state of \"extraordinary crisis\".[274] Its violent attempts to govern territory led to a backlash from Sunni Arab Iraqis and other insurgent groups and a temporary decline in the group, which was attributable to a number of factors,[275] notably the Anbar Awakening.\n", "In late 2009, the commander of US forces in Iraq, General Ray Odierno, stated that ISI \"has transformed significantly in the last two years. What once was dominated by foreign individuals has now become more and more dominated by Iraqi citizens\".[276] On 18 April 2010, ISI's two top leaders, al-Masri and Omar al-Baghdadi, were killed in a joint US-Iraqi raid near Tikrit.[277] In a press conference in June 2010, General Odierno reported that 80% of ISI's top 42 leaders, including recruiters and financiers, had been killed or captured, with only eight remaining at large. He said that they had been cut off from al-Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan.[278][279][280]\n", "On 16 May 2010, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was appointed the new leader of ISI.[281][282] Al-Baghdadi replenished the group's leadership by appointing former Iraqi military and Intelligence Service officers who had served during Saddam Hussein's rule.[168][283] These men, nearly all of whom had spent time imprisoned by the US military at Camp Bucca, came to make up about one third of Baghdadi's top 25 commanders, including Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi, Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, and Abu Muslim al-Turkmani. One of them, a former colonel called Samir al-Khlifawi, also known as Haji Bakr, became the overall military commander in charge of overseeing the group's operations.[167][284] Al-Khlifawi was instrumental in doing the ground work that led to the growth of ISIL.[285][143]\n", "In July 2012, al-Baghdadi released an audio statement online announcing that the group was returning to former strongholds from which US troops and the Sons of Iraq had driven them in 2007 and 2008.[286] He declared the start of a new offensive in Iraq called Breaking the Walls, aimed at freeing members of the group held in Iraqi prisons.[286]\nViolence in Iraq had begun to escalate in June 2012, primarily with AQI's car bomb attacks, and by July 2013, monthly fatalities exceeded 1,000 for the first time since April 2008.[287]\n", "In March 2011, protests began in Syria against the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad. In the following months, violence between demonstrators and security forces led to a gradual militarisation of the conflict.[288] In August 2011, following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, al-Baghdadi began sending Syrian and Iraqi ISI members experienced in guerilla warfare across the border into Syria to establish an organisation there. Under the name Jabhat an-Nuṣrah li-Ahli ash-Shām (or al-Nusra Front), it established a large presence in Sunni-majority Raqqa, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor, and Aleppo provinces. Led by a Syrian known as Abu Muhammad al-Julani, this group began to recruit fighters and establish cells throughout the country.[289][290]\n", "On 23 January 2012, the Syrian group called itself Jabhat al-Nusra li Ahl as-Sham,[291] more commonly known as the al-Nusra Front. Al-Nusra grew rapidly into a capable fighting force, with popular support among Syrians opposed to the Assad government.[289]\n", "\n", "On 8 April 2013, al-Baghdadi released an audio statement in which he announced that the al-Nusra Front had been established, financed, and supported by ISI,[292] and that the two groups were merging under the name Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIL, Al-Sham also translates as the Levant).[293] However, Abu Mohammad al-Julani and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger. Al-Julani issued a statement denying the merger, and complaining that neither he nor anyone else in al-Nusra's leadership had been consulted about it.[294] In June 2013, Al Jazeera reported that it had obtained a letter written by al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, addressed to both leaders, in which he ruled against the merger, and appointed an emissary to oversee relations between them to put an end to tensions.[295] That same month, al-Baghdadi released an audio message rejecting al-Zawahiri's ruling and declaring that the merger was going ahead.[296]\n", "Meanwhile, the ISIL campaign to free its imprisoned members culminated in simultaneous raids on Taji and Abu Ghraib prisons in July 2013, freeing more than 500 prisoners, many of them veterans of the Iraqi insurgency.[287][297] In October 2013, al-Zawahiri ordered the disbanding of ISIL, putting al-Nusra Front in charge of jihadist efforts in Syria,[298] but al-Baghdadi rejected al-Zawahiri's order,[296] and his group continued to operate in Syria. In February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relations with ISIL.[299]\n", "According to journalist Sarah Birke, there are \"significant differences\" between al-Nusra Front and ISIL. While al-Nusra actively calls for the overthrow of the Assad government, ISIL \"tends to be more focused on establishing its own rule on conquered territory\". ISIL is \"far more ruthless\" in building an Islamic state, \"carrying out sectarian attacks and imposing sharia law immediately\". While al-Nusra has a \"large contingent of foreign fighters\", it is seen as a home-grown group by many Syrians; by contrast, ISIL fighters have been described as \"foreign 'occupiers'\" by many Syrian refugees.[300] Foreign fighters in Syria include Russian-speaking jihadists who were part of Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar (JMA).[301] In November 2013, Abu Omar al-Shishani, leader of the Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar (JMA), swore an oath of allegiance to al-Baghdadi;[302] the group then split between those who followed al-Shishani in joining ISIL and those who continued to operate independently in the JMA under new leadership.[303]\n", "In January 2014, rebels affiliated with the Islamic Front and the US-trained Free Syrian Army[304] launched an offensive against ISIL militants in and around the city of Aleppo, following months of tensions over ISIL's behavior, which included the seizure of property and weapons from rebel groups, and the arrests and killings of activists.[305][306] Months of clashes ensued, causing thousands of casualties, with ISIL withdrawing its forces from Idlib and Latakia provinces and redeploying them to reinforce its strongholds in Raqqa and Aleppo.[307] It also launched an offensive against all other opposition forces active in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, on the border with Iraq.[308][309] By June 2014, ISIL had largely defeated its rivals in the province, with many who had not been killed or driven away pledging allegiance to it.[310][311]\n", "In Iraq, ISIL was able to capture most of Fallujah in January 2014,[312] and in June 2014 was able to seize control of Mosul.[73]\n", "After an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with ISIL by February 2014, citing its failure to consult and \"notorious intransigence\".[4][299]\n", "In early 2014, ISIL drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in its Anbar campaign,[72] which was followed by the capture of Mosul[73] and the Sinjar massacre.[74] The loss of control almost caused a collapse of the Iraqi government and prompted a renewal of US military action in Iraq. In Syria, ISIL has conducted ground attacks on both the Syrian Arab Army and rebel factions.\n", "\n", "On 29 June 2014, ISIL proclaimed itself to be a worldwide caliphate.[313] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi – known by his supporters as Amir al-Mu'minin, Caliph Ibrahim – was named its caliph, and the group renamed itself ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah (\"Islamic State\" (IS)).[79] As a \"Caliphate\", it claims religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide.[81] The concept of it being a caliphate and the name \"Islamic State\" have been rejected by governments and Muslim leaders worldwide.[102][103][314][106][107][109][105]\n", "In June and July 2014, Jordan and Saudi Arabia moved troops to their borders with Iraq, after the Iraqi government lost control of (or withdrew from) strategic crossing points that then came under the control of either ISIL or tribes that supported it.[315][316] There was speculation that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had ordered a withdrawal of troops from the Iraq–Saudi crossings in order \"to increase pressure on Saudi Arabia and bring the threat of ISIS over-running its borders as well\".[317]\n", "In July 2014, ISIL recruited more than 6,300 fighters, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, some of whom were thought to have previously fought for the Free Syrian Army.[318] On 23 July 2014, Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Totoni Hapilon and some masked men swore loyalty to al-Baghdadi in a video, giving ISIL a presence in the Philippines.[88][319] In September 2014, the group began kidnapping people for ransom.[320]\n", "In 2016, according to the daily, La Stampa, officials from Europol conducted an investigation into the trafficking of fake documents for ISIL. They have identified fake Syrian passports in the refugee camps in Greece that were destined to supposed members of ISIS, in order to avoid Greek government controls and make their way to other parts of Europe.[321] Also, the chief of Europol said that a new task force of 200 counter terrorism officers will be deployed to the Greek islands alongside Greek border guards in order to help Greece thwart a \"strategic\" level campaign by Islamic State to infiltrate terrorists into Europe.[322]\n", "On 3 August 2014, ISIL captured the cities of Zumar, Sinjar, and Wana in northern Iraq.[74] Thousands of Yazidis fled up Mount Sinjar, fearful of the approaching hostile ISIL militants. The stranded Yazidis' need for food and water, the threat of genocide to them and to others announced by ISIL, along with the desire to protect US citizens in Iraq and support the Iraqi government in its fight against ISIL, were all reasons given for the 2014 American intervention in Iraq, which began on 7 August.[323] A US aerial bombing campaign began the following day.\n", "At the end of October 2014, 800 militants gained partial control of the Libyan city of Derna and pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, thus making Derna the first city outside Syria and Iraq to be a part of the \"Islamic State Caliphate\".[324] On 10 November 2014, a major faction of the Egyptian militant group Ansar Bait al-Maqdis also pledged its allegiance to ISIL.[325] In mid-January 2015, a Yemeni official said that ISIL had \"dozens\" of members in Yemen, and that they were coming into direct competition with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula because of their recruitment drive.[326] The same month, Afghan officials confirmed that ISIL had a military presence in Afghanistan.[327] However, by February 2015, 65 of the militants were either captured or killed by the Taliban, and ISIL's top Afghan recruiter, Mullah Abdul Rauf, was killed in a US drone strike.[328][329][330]\n", "In early February 2015, ISIL militants in Libya managed to capture part of the countryside to the west of Sabha, and later, an area encompassing the cities of Sirte, Nofolia, and a military base to the south of both cities.

It has been active particularly around Derna, and Gaddafi's hometown Sirte.[372][373] The group grew quickly following the allegiance of militant groups like the Shura Council of Islamic Youth.[374][375]\n", "ISIL temporarily controlled part of Derna before being driven out in mid-2015 by a rival militant Islamist group, with support from the Libyan Air Force.[376][377]  Libya's Interim Government launched a major offensive against ISIL territory around Sirte in May 2016,[378][379] capturing the city by December 2016.[380] The Libyan National Army, led by Commander General Khalifa Haftar, has also clashed with ISIL, making advances against the group in Benghazi and Ajdabiya.[381][382][383]\n", "Since the Battle of Sirte (12 May – 6 December 2016) ISIL lost most of its territories in Libya to the forces of the Government of National Accord (GNA), backed by the United States.[384] And as of  11 November 2017[update] the last pockets of the ISIL-affiliated Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries were captured by the LNA after three years of fighting.[385]\n", "On 10 November 2014, many members of the group Ansar Bait al-Maqdis took an oath of allegiance to al-Baghdadi.[325] Following this, the group assumed the designation Sinai Province (Wilayat Sinai).[374][386][387][388] They are estimated to have 1,000–2,000 fighters.[88][389] A faction of the Sinai group also operates in the Gaza Strip, calling itself the Islamic State in Gaza.[390] It claimed responsibility for the downing of Russian Metrojet Flight 9268, which killed all 224 people on board, although Egyptian officials disputed the claim.[391]\n", "Members of Jund al-Khilafah swore allegiance to ISIL in September 2014.[392] ISIL in Algeria gained notoriety when it beheaded French tourist Herve Gourdel in September 2014.

Another 128 surrendered to Taliban. Eight Taliban and six ISIS fighters were reportedly killed in the battle.[397]\n", "On 13 November 2014, unidentified militants in Yemen pledged allegiance to ISIL.[392] By December of that year, ISIL had built an active presence inside Yemen, with its recruitment drive bringing it into direct competition with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).[326][398] In February 2015, it was reported that some members of Ansar al-Sharia in Yemen had split from AQAP and pledged allegiance to ISIL.[399] As the Yemeni Civil War escalated in March 2015, at least seven ISIL Wilayat, named after existing provincial boundaries in Yemen, claimed responsibility for attacks against the Houthis, including the Hadhramaut Province, the Shabwah Province, and the Sana'a Province.[400][401]\n", "Zaidiyyah Houthis (organised in the Supreme Revolutionary Committee) are the principal enemies of Yemen's ISIL branch.[402][403] While the US government supports the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen against the Houthis,[404] many in United States Special Operations Command favour the Houthis, as they have been an effective force in rolling back al-Qaeda and recently ISIL in Yemen, \"something that hundreds of U.S. drone strikes and large numbers of advisers to Yemen's military had failed to accomplish\".[405] The Guardian reported: \"As another 50 civilians die in the forgotten war, only Isis and al-Qaida are gaining from a conflict tearing Yemen apart and leaving 20 million people in need of aid.\"[406]\n", "On 7 March 2015, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant via an audio message posted on the organisation's Twitter account.[407][408] On 12 March 2015, ISIL's spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani released an audio tape in which he welcomed the pledge of allegiance, and described it as an expansion of the group's caliphate into West Africa.[6] ISIL publications from late March 2015 began referring to members of Boko Haram as part of Wilayat Gharb Afriqiya (West Africa Province).[401] The group suffered a split in 2016, with ISIL appointing 'Abu Musab al-Barnawi' as the group's new leader, due to disagreements with Abubakar Shekau's leadership.[409] This was rejected by Shekau and his supporters, who continued to operate independently.[410]\n", "Some commanders of the Caucasus Emirate in Chechnya and Dagestan switched their allegiance to ISIL in late 2014 and early 2015.[411] On 23 June 2015, ISIL spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani accepted the pledges of allegiance and announced a new Caucasus Province (Wilayat al-Qawqaz) under the leadership of Rustam Asildarov.[366][8]\n", "On 23 July 2014, Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Totoni Hapilon in the Philippines swore an oath of loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIL.[319] In September 2014, the group began kidnapping people so they could be held for ransom, in the name of ISIL.[320] In early 2015, members of Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao pledged allegiance to ISIL. At the same time, Ansar Khalifa Philippines was born from a merger of Ansar Khalifah Sarangani with other umbrella groups that are pro-ISIL in nature.[citation needed] In May 2017, a pro-ISIL group called the Maute group attacked and seized parts of the southern Philippine city of Marawi on Mindanao island.[412]\n", "On 17 October 2017, Philippine President Duterte declared Marawi was \"liberated from terrorist influence\".[413] Then on 23 October 2017, Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced that the five-month battle against the terrorists in Marawi had finally ended.[414] The recapture of Marawi by the government led to the failure of militants to establish a provincial ISIL territory (wilayat) in the Philippines.\n", "In February 2014, the Mujahideen Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem declared its support for ISIL.[415] On 2 April 2015, elements of this group, along with members of the Army of Islam and the Gaza faction of Ansar Bait al-Maqdis,[416][417] formed the Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade, also known as Islamic State in Gaza,[418] as it predominantly operates in the Gaza Strip.\n", "Many countries and international bodies have officially designated ISIL as a terrorist organisation.\n", "\n", "\n", "The group has attracted widespread criticism internationally for its extremism, from governments and international bodies such as the United Nations and Amnesty International. On 24 September 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon stated: \"As Muslim leaders around the world have said, groups like ISIL – or Da'ish – have nothing to do with Islam, and they certainly do not represent a state. They should more fittingly be called the 'Un-Islamic Non-State'.\"[425] ISIL has been classified a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many other countries (see § Classification). Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see § Countries and groups at war with ISIL). The group was described as a cult in a Huffington Post column by notable cult authority Steven Hassan.[426]\n", "Around the world, Islamic religious leaders have overwhelmingly condemned ISIL's ideology and actions, arguing that the group has strayed from the path of true Islam and that its actions do not reflect the religion's real teachings or virtues.[427]\n", "Extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century, to the Khawarijes. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. They were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed worthy of death.[428][429][430][431] Other scholars have also described the group not as Sunnis, but as Khawarij.[429][432] Sunni critics, including Salafi and jihadist muftis such as Adnan al-Aroor and Abu Basir al-Tartusi, say that ISIL and related terrorist groups are not Sunnis, but are instead modern-day Kharijites (Muslims who have stepped outside the mainstream of Islam) serving an imperial anti-Islamic agenda.[433]\n", "\nISIL has received severe criticism from Muslim religious scholars and theologians. In late August 2014, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, condemned ISIL and al-Qaeda saying, \"Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on Earth, destroying human civilization, are not in any way part of Islam, but are enemy number one of Islam, and Muslims are their first victims\".[434] In late September 2014, 126 Sunni imams and Islamic scholars—primarily Sufi[435]—from around the Muslim world signed an open letter to the Islamic State's leader al-Baghdadi, explicitly rejecting and refuting his group's interpretations of Islamic scriptures, the Quran and hadith, which it used in order to justify its actions.[436][437] \"[You] have misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder ... this is a great wrong and an offence to Islam, to Muslims and to the entire world\", the letter states.[438] It rebukes the Islamic State for its killing of prisoners, describing the killings as \"heinous war crimes\" and its persecution of the Yazidis of Iraq as \"abominable\". Referring to the \"self-described 'Islamic State'\", the letter censures the group for carrying out killings and acts of brutality under the guise of jihad—holy struggle—saying that its \"sacrifice\" without legitimate cause, goals and intention \"is not jihad at all, but rather, warmongering and criminality\".[438][439] It also accuses the group of instigating fitna—sedition—by instituting slavery under its rule in contravention of the anti-slavery consensus of the Islamic scholarly community.[438] ", "\n", "According to The New York Times, \"All of the most influential jihadist theorists are criticising the Islamic State as deviant, calling its self-proclaimed caliphate null and void\" and they have denounced it for its beheadings of journalists and aid workers.[123] ISIL is widely denounced by a broad range of Islamic clerics, including al-Qaeda-oriented clerics and Saudi clerics.[12][123] Muhammad al-Yaqoubi states, \"It is enough of a proof of the extreme ideology of ISIS that the top leaders of Salafi-Jihadism have disclaimed it.\"[440]\n Other critics of ISIL's brand of Sunni Islam include Salafists who previously publicly supported jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda: for example, the Saudi government official Saleh Al-Fawzan, known for his extremist views, who claims that ISIL is a creation of \"Zionists, Crusaders and Safavids\", and the Jordanian-Palestinian writer Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the former spiritual mentor to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was released from prison in Jordan in June 2014 and accused ISIL of driving a wedge between Muslims.[433]\n", "The group's declaration of a caliphate has been criticised and its legitimacy has been disputed by Middle Eastern governments, other jihadist groups,[441] and by Sunni Muslim theologians and historians. Qatar-based TV broadcaster and theologian Yusuf al-Qaradawi stated: \"[The] declaration issued by the Islamic State is void under sharia and has dangerous consequences for the Sunnis in Iraq and for the revolt in Syria\", adding that the title of caliph can \"only be given by the entire Muslim nation\", not by a single group.[442] The group's execution of Muslims for breach of traditional sharia law while violating it itself (encouraging women to emigrate to its territory, travelling without a Wali—male guardian—and in violation of his wishes) has been criticised;[443] as has its love of archaic imagery (horsemen and swords) while engaging in bid'ah (religious innovation) in establishing female religious police (known as Al-Khansaa Brigade).[444] In a similar vein, the Syrian Islamic scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi says, \"[t]he followers of ISIS do not want to adhere to Islamic law but rather they want to twist Islamic law to conform to their fantasies. To this end, they pick and choose the evidences that corroborate their misguidance, despite being weak or abrogated.\"[445]\n", "Two days after the beheading of Hervé Gourdel, hundreds of Muslims gathered in the Grand Mosque of Paris to show solidarity against the beheading. The protest was led by the leader of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, Dalil Boubakeur, and was joined by thousands of other Muslims around the country under the slogan \"Not in my name\".[446][447] French president François Hollande said Gourdel's beheading was \"cowardly\" and \"cruel\", and confirmed that airstrikes would continue against ISIL in Iraq. Hollande also called for three days of national mourning, with flags flown at half-mast throughout the country and said that security would be increased throughout Paris.[446]\n", "An Islamic Front sharia court judge in Aleppo, Mohamed Najeeb Bannan, stated: \"The legal reference is the Islamic Sharia. The cases are different, from robberies to drug use, to moral crimes. It's our duty to look at any crime that comes to us... After the regime has fallen, we believe that the Muslim majority in Syria will ask for an Islamic state. Of course, it's very important to point out that some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all.\" In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, \"One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen [having a stable state], they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [IS] did wrong. This is going to cause a lot of trouble. Anyone who opposes [IS] will be considered against Sharia and will be severely punished.\"[448][449]\n", "Al-Qaeda and al-Nusra have been trying to take advantage of ISIL's rise, by attempting to present themselves as \"moderate\" compared to \"extremist\" ISIL, although it has the same aim of establishing sharia and a caliphate but doing so in a more gradual manner.[450][451][452][453][454] Al-Nusra has criticised the way in which ISIL fully and immediately institutes sharia in the areas that fall under its control, since it alienates people too much.  It supports the gradual, slower approach favoured by al-Qaeda, preparing society to accept sharia and indoctrinating people through education before implementing the hudud aspects of sharia, such as throwing gays from the top of buildings, chopping limbs off, and public stoning.[134] Al-Nusra and ISIL are both hostile towards the Druze.  However, while al-Nusra has typically destroyed Druze shrines and pressured them to convert to Sunni Islam, ISIL regards the entire Druze community as a valid target for violence, as it does the Yazidis.[455]\n", "Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, has called for consultation (shura) within the \"prophetic method\" to be used when establishing the caliphate, criticising al-Baghdadi for not following the required steps. Al-Zawahiri has called upon ISIL members to close ranks and join al-Qaeda in fighting against Assad, the Shia, Russia, Europe, and America and to stop the infighting between jihadist groups.  He called upon jihadists to establish Islamic entities in Egypt and the Levant, slowly implementing sharia before establishing a caliphate, and has called for violent assaults against America and the West.[456]\n", "The Jaysh al-Islam group within the Islamic Front criticised ISIL, saying: \"They killed the people of Islam and leave the idol worshippers ... They use the verses talking about the disbelievers and implement it on the Muslims\".[457] The main criticism of defectors from ISIL has been that the group is fighting and killing other Sunni Muslims,[458] as opposed to just non-Sunnis being brutalised.[459][460] In one case, a supposed defector from ISIL executed two activists of a Syrian opposition group in Turkey who had sheltered them.[461]\n", "The current Grand Imam of al-Azhar and former president of al-Azhar University, Ahmed el-Tayeb, has strongly condemned the Islamic State, stating that it is acting \"under the guise of this holy religion and have given themselves the name 'Islamic State' in an attempt to export their false Islam\".[462][463] Citing the Quran, he stated: \"The punishment for those who wage war against God and his Prophet and who strive to sow corruption on earth is death, crucifixion, the severing of hands and feet on opposite sides or banishment from the land. This is the disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they will receive grievous torment.\" Although el-Tayeb has been criticised for not expressly stating that the Islamic State is heretical,[464][465] the Ash'ari school of Islamic theology, to which el-Tayeb belongs, does not allow calling a person who follows the shahada an apostate.[464] El-Tayeb has strongly come out against the practice of takfirism (declaring a Muslim an apostate) which is used by the Islamic State to \"judge and accuse anyone who doesn't tow their line with apostasy and outside the realm of the faith\" declaring \"Jihad on peaceful Muslims\" using \"flawed interpretations of some Qur'anic texts, the prophet's Sunna, and the Imams' views believing incorrectly, that they are leaders of Muslim armies fighting infidel peoples, in unbelieving lands\".[466]\n", "In late December 2015, nearly 70,000 Indian Muslim clerics associated with the Indian Barelvi movement issued a fatwa condemning ISIL and similar organisations, saying they are \"not Islamic organisations\".

Private donors within Qatar, sympathetic to the aims of radical groups such as al-Nusra Front and ISIL, are believed to be channeling their resources to support these organisations.[565][566] According to the US Treasury Department, a number of terrorist financiers have been operating in Qatar. Qatari citizen Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi has served as an interlocutor between Qatari donors and leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Nuaimi reportedly oversaw the transfer of US$2 million per month to AQI over a period of time.

ISIL fighters have reportedly been given written directions to kill or capture journalists.[746]\n", "In December 2013, two suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of TV station Salaheddin and killed five journalists, after accusing the station of \"distorting the image of Iraq's Sunni community\". Reporters Without Borders reported that on 7 September 2014, ISIL seized and on 11 October publicly beheaded Raad al-Azzawi, a TV Salaheddin cameraman from the village of Samra, east of Tikrit.[747] As of  October 2014[update], according to the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, ISIL is holding nine journalists and has nine others under close observation in Mosul and Salahuddin province.[746]\n", "During 2013 and part of 2014, an ISIL unit nicknamed the Beatles acquired and held 12 Western journalists hostage, along with aid workers and other foreign hostages, totalling 23 or 24 known hostages. A Polish journalist Marcin Suder was captured in July 2013 but escaped four months later.[748] The unit executed American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and released beheading videos. Eight of the other journalists were released for ransom: Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, French journalists Didier François, Edouard Elias, Nicolas Hénin, and Pierre Torres, and Spanish journalists Marc Marginedas, Javier Espinosa, and Ricardo García Vilanova. The unit continues to hold hostage British journalist John Cantlie and a female aid worker.[749]\n", "Cyber-security group the Citizen Lab released a report finding a possible link between ISIL and a digital attack on the Syrian citizen media group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RSS). Supporters of the media group received an emailed link to an image of supposed airstrikes, but clicking on the link introduced malware to the user's computer that sends details of the user's IP address and system each time it restarts. That information has been enough to allow ISIL to locate RSS supporters. \"The group has been targeted for kidnappings, house raids, and at least one alleged targeted killing. At the time of that writing, ISIL was allegedly holding several citizen journalists in Raqqa\", according to the Citizen Lab report.[750]\n", "On 8 January 2015, ISIL members in Libya claimed to have executed Tunisian journalists Sofiene Chourabi and Nadhir Ktari who disappeared in September 2014.[751] Also in January 2015, Japanese journalist Kenji Goto was kidnapped and beheaded, after a demand for a $200 million ransom payment was not met.[752]\n", "An unknown number of Syrians and Iraqis, several Lebanese soldiers, male and female Kurdish fighters near Kobanî, two American journalists, one American and two British aid workers, 30 Ethiopian Christians[753] and 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya[754] have been beheaded by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL uses beheadings to intimidate local populations and has released a series of propaganda videos aimed at Western countries.[75]\nISIL was reported to have beheaded about 100 foreign fighters as deserters who tried to leave Raqqa.[755]\n", "They also engage in public and mass executions of Syrian and Iraqi soldiers and civilians,[530] sometimes forcing prisoners to dig their own graves before shooting lines of prisoners and pushing them in.[756][757] Among the known mass executions of captured soldiers carried out by ISIL are those in Tikrit (ISIS executed up to 1,700 Shia Iraqi Air Force cadets from Camp Speicher near Tikrit on 12 June 2014),[758][759] Al-Thawrah (ISIS executed 250 Syrian soldiers captured at the Al-Tabqa air base between 27 and 28 August 2014),[760] Palmyra (up to 280 Syrian soldiers and government loyalists were shot in the head or beheaded in a public square on 22 May 2015),[761] and Deir ez-Zor (ISIS killed at least 300 Syrian soldiers, pro-government militiamen and their families on 16 January 2016).[762]\n", "ISIS executed 600 Shia prisoners in Mosul in June 2014.[763] In November 2014, there were reports that ISIS fighters massacred more than 630 members of the Albu Nimr tribe in Iraq. Albu Nimr was one of the Sunni Arab tribes that fiercely opposed the Islamic State.[764] On 17 December 2014, it was reported by Turkish media, that the ISIS had executed at least 150 women from the Albu Nimr tribe in Falluja for refusing to marry ISIS militants.[765]\n", "Kurds in northern Iraq reported being attacked by ISIS with chemical weapons in August 2015,[766] which was later confirmed to be mustard gas.[767] At Kobanî, it is highly likely that ISIS used chlorine gas. These chemical weapons may be from a chemical weapons storage site at Al-Muthanna, which contained 2,500 chemical rockets. Although the rockets' chemical contents were deteriorated, ISIS may have used them in a concentrated manner.[768]\n", "UNESCO's Director-General Irina Bokova has warned that ISIL is destroying Iraq's cultural heritage, in what she has called \"cultural cleansing\". \"We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, because they know that if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history\", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, \"This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it goes hand in hand with genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate – to delete – the memory of these different cultures ... we think this is appalling, and this is not acceptable.\"[769] Saad Eskander, head of Iraq's National Archives said, \"For the first time you have cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written. By destroying their places of worship... you are killing cultural memory. It is the same with the Christians – it really is a threat beyond belief.\"[770]\n", "To finance its activities, ISIL is stealing artefacts from Syria[771] and Iraq and sending them to Europe to be sold.  UNESCO has asked for United Nations Security Council controls on the sale of antiquities, similar to those imposed after the 2003 Iraq War. UNESCO is working with Interpol, national customs authorities, museums, and major auction houses in attempts to prevent looted items from being sold.[770] ISIL occupied Mosul Museum, the second most important museum in Iraq, as it was about to reopen after years of rebuilding following the Iraq War, saying that the statues were against Islam and threatening to destroy the museum's contents.[772][773]\n", "ISIL considers worshipping at graves tantamount to idolatry, and seeks to purify the community of unbelievers. It has used bulldozers to crush buildings and archaeological sites.[773] Bernard Haykel has described al-Baghdadi's creed as \"a kind of untamed Wahhabism\", saying, \"For Al Qaeda, violence is a means to an ends [sic]; for ISIS, it is an end in itself\".[123] The destruction by ISIL in July 2014 of the tomb and shrine of the prophet Yunus – Jonah in Christianity – the 13th-century mosque of Imam Yahya Abu al-Qassimin, the 14th-century shrine of prophet Jerjis – St George to Christians – and the attempted destruction of the Hadba minaret at the 12th-century Great Mosque of Al-Nuri have been described as \"an unchecked outburst of extreme Wahhabism\".[citation needed] \"There were explosions that destroyed buildings dating back to the Assyrian era\", said National Museum of Iraq director Qais Rashid, referring to the destruction of the shrine of Yunus. He cited another case where \"Daesh (ISIL) gathered over 1,500 manuscripts from convents and other holy places and burnt all of them in the middle of the city square\".[774] In March 2015, ISIL reportedly bulldozed the 13th-century BC Assyrian city of Nimrud, believing its sculptures to be idolatrous. UNESCO head, Irina Bokova, deemed this to be a war crime.[775]\n", "ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from the various locations including the Central Library of Mosul (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),[776] the library at the University of Mosul, a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BCE and include \"Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul's establishment families.\" The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books.\n", "CNN, Ben Wedeman and Lauren Said-Moorhouse. \"ISIS has lost its final stronghold in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces says\".

artillery, and special forces personnel, that began on 9 February 2019 as part of the Deir ez-Zor campaign of the Syrian Civil War. The battle, composed of a series of ground assaults, took place in and around the Syrian town of Al-Baghuz Fawqani in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, near the Iraq–Syria border, and was regarded as the territorial last stand of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in eastern Syria.[41][42]\n", "After shrinking the Islamic State into a densely populated cluster of hamlets and a tent city along the riverside within the first week, the SDF realised that a greater than anticipated number of civilians, mostly relatives of the mostly foreign ISIL fighters, were still in the enclave. With Coalition oversight, the SDF took an incremental approach to the battle, launching fierce assaults then pausing to allow surrendering fighters, hostages, and families to evacuate in order to minimize civilian casualties. The \"trickle-out\" strategy, coupled with stiff, fanatical resistance by veteran Islamic State jihadists within a small but dense area, prolonged the battle into a protracted siege.[43] The SDF officially declared final victory over the Islamic State in Baghuz Fawqani on 23 March, marking the end of ISIL-controlled territories in Syria.[44]\n", "Since September 2017, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) had been on a campaign to wrest territorial control from the Islamic State terror group in eastern Syria. The SDF's advances were supported by American, British, and French forces from the CJTF-OIR Coalition via close air support, French and American artillery, and American special forces assistance and oversight. The SDF launched its third and final phase of their campaign in September 2018, gradually capturing the remaining ISIL pocket of territory straddling the Euphrates river near the Iraq-Syria border.[45] By 1 February 2019, ISIL was reduced to four square kilometers of territory, boxed in against the river with the SDF advancing from the northwest, Syrian government forces blocking river crossings, and Iraqi forces deployed to prevent cross-border infiltrations. The massive exodus of civilians complicated advances, with the SDF pausing its advance for almost 10 days prior to the battle.[46] Within the 10 days preceding the battle, over 20,000 civilians fled the enclave.[47][48]\nThe SDF stated that a number of foreign hostages, including missing British journalist John Cantlie and the kidnapped Italian Jesuit priest Father Paolo Dall'Oglio, were possibly being held in the enclave.[49]\n", "On 9 February 2019, France's Defense minister Florence Parly visited Firebase Saham, a joint French-U.S. artillery fire support base near Al-Qa'im, Iraq, that supported the SDF's anti-ISIL campaign. Meeting with French forces there, Parly told them not to be distracted and that France \"is determined to complete this fight against those who have struck her,\" referring to terror attacks in France in recent years conducted by ISIL loyalists.[50]\n", "The Syrian Democratic Forces announced the decisive, \"final battle\" against the Islamic State enclave on the evening of 9 February 2019. Available SDF forces in the offensive consisted of around 15,000 fighters, backed by Coalition artillery and close air support, along with assistance from the U.S. Army special forces and, according to a YPG commander, the British Special Air Service.[51][52] It was initially estimated that ISIL still had around 400–1,000 of its most committed, battle-hardened jihadist fighters resisting to the bitter end, though general estimates still varied widely.[53]\n", "The battle began with a heavy preemptive bombardment throughout the afternoon from SDF mortar teams and U.S. bombers, including B-1B Lancers,[23] with intermittent sniper engagements and machine gun clashes throughout the day. Fighting continued into the night with the SDF only advancing until nightfall as Coalition flares illuminated the battlefield[54] amidst numerous air raids and \"constant\" shelling of al-Baghuz Fawqani; local sources reported night fighting over the Baghuz-Bukhamal bridge as well.[55] The SDF reported the deaths of 37 ISIL members along with the destruction of 19 enemy forward positions, four roads, one mortar piece, one motorbike, and one weapons cache during the preemptive bombardment.[56]\n", "Throughout the night of 9 February and into the morning of 10 February, the SDF scored early advances, seizing 41 tactical points within a total of 2 square kilometers of land while repelling an ISIL counterattack at 4 a.m. local. The SDF reported killing many ISIL fighters while only losing 2 of their own. They also reportedly secured a humanitarian corridor for 200 civilians to flee the fighting.[57][58] SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali, commenting on alleged behind the scenes negotiations between ISIL, the SDF, and the Coalition, stated that Islamic State representatives had asked for safe passage out of the pocket. Bali said that the SDF would \"fight until the very last minute\"; however, American negotiators allegedly stated that safe passage to the Idlib Governorate, dominated by ISIL's rival Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was an offer still on the table.[59] Meanwhile, commenting on the battle, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted \"The U.S. will soon control 100% of ISIS territory in Syria.\"[60]\n", "By the morning of 11 February, another 1,500 civilians had fled the area in a column of 17 trucks filled with men, women, and children, some identifying as Iraqi.[61] Hundreds of civilians continued to stream out of the enclave into SDF-Coalition makeshift screening centers established for filtering out fleeing jihadists. One YPG commander stated that some desperate ISIL militants would resort to wearing women's clothing when fleeing. \"[ISIL fighters] have been trying to escape in women's clothes,\" the commander said, explaining that \"some of them dress as women because we don't ask the women to raise their hijab.\"[62]\n", "The Coalition's combat missions continued; Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan stated the SDF were making \"significant progress\" despite poor weather conditions. Poor visibility such as overcast weather or dust storms typically benefited ISIL fighters as it concealed some of their ground deployments and hindered SDF-Coalition reconnaissance. The Coalition said that despite the poor weather, airstrikes were being called in \"whenever possible\". ISIL elements were entrenched and fortified, leaving the SDF to rely greatly on Coalition air power to soften defenses and dislodge strongpoints. The U.S. bombed a mosque in the town allegedly being used as an ISIL command and control center to direct attacks and deploy suicide car bombs (SVBIEDs) against the SDF. \"This mosque lost its protected status when ISIS deliberately chose to use it as a command and control center,\" the Coalition stated. The mosque strike came amid reports that ISIL was deliberately using human shields in order to deter Coalition targeting and impede the SDF's advance. Syrian state media reported that about 70 people were killed or wounded on the edge of the town after an airstrike hit a settlement where hundreds of people were taking shelter. A Coalition spokesman responded, \"we are aware of open source reports of alleged civilian casualties. We take all allegations of civilian casualties seriously, and understand there is a lot of misinformation as well.\"[63]\n", "The sound of explosions and gunfire echoed dozens of kilometers away from the battlefield as intense Coalition airstrikes and SDF missile attacks continued; eyewitnesses described the mushrooming columns of white and dark grey smoke billowing over the skyline as warplanes and missiles streaked through the sky.[64] The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitor said the SDF was advancing at a slower momentum than initially expected due to ISIL's usage of tunnels to navigate the battlefield along with deploying snipers, VBIEDs, anti-tank guided missiles, and land mines against the SDF, forcing them to simultaneously conduct de-mining operations with every advance. United States Central Command (CENTCOM) commander Gen. Joseph Votel, who oversees the United States' middle east operations, commented on the battle during a trip to Cairo. \"It's a relatively confined space, it's heavily urbanized, it's laden with a lot of explosive hazards, improvised explosive devices for example, and kind of a prepared defense by ISIS,\" he said, emphasizing the asymmetrical warfare commonly associated with fighting ISIL.[65]\n", "Estimates on the number of remaining ISIL militants in the enclave varied; SDF officials and SOHR estimated there were around 3,000 mostly foreign ISIL jihadists remaining, though previous Coalition estimates put the number at about half that.[66] On 10 February, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said up to 600 fighters were still present in Baghuz Fawqani proper.[67] Claims of ongoing backdoor negotiations also persisted, though an SDF source denied any such talks were happening, saying that the SDF demanded an unconditional ISIL surrender.[68] Meanwhile, Italian media reported freelance photographer Gabriele Micalizzi was badly, though not critically, wounded in the head by splinters from an rocket-propelled grenade. Micalizzi was airlifted by the Coalition to Baghdad to be evacuated back to Italy.[40] The Observatory said 13 ISIL militants, including five suicide attackers, were killed as well as six SDF fighters in recent fighting.[60] 16 civilians were reported to have been killed in airstrikes by the end of 11 February.[69]\n", "On 12 February, civilians continued to flee on the back of dusty trucks filled with women and children bound for Kurdish-ran camps in northeastern Syria. The civilian truck drivers said 18 foreigners were among the dozens of civilians fleeing with them, including Russians, Turks, and Ukrainians. Regional and foreign journalists clambered over the edges of the trucks to find non-Arabs among the civilians, some shouting \"France? France?\" One fleeing civilian, a mother of five, described the bombing as \"unimaginable\". \"There was no food. We ate grass from the ground like sheep... Daesh had blocked the roads and smugglers wanted thousands of U.S. dollars,\" she added.[70] Two Muslim-convert French mothers that paid to be smuggled out of the enclave claimed that \"massacres\" were taking place inside the town while many others starved. Only Syrian and Iraqi women were allowed to be smuggled out, according to the women.[71]\n", "Violent clashes continued throughout 12 February; Coalition airstrikes bombarded entire districts, such as the Sheikh Hamad neighborhood, as the SDF captured the Baghuz-Bukamal Bridge and made advances in the Al-Khanafirah neighborhood. A fleet of 15 vehicles carrying U.S. soldiers was seen reinforcing a secondary front line as ISIL units used ambush tactics and fielded machine guns and anti-tank guided missiles against SDF positions.[72][73][74] Local eyewitnesses said ISIL was using trash and tire fires to fill the skyline with thick smoke to complicate Coalition airstrike capabilities and to make the air harder to breathe for SDF troops. Syrian reporter Mushin Khalil reported at least 14 SDF fighters were killed on the 12th in an ISIL counterattack that involved a suicide bomber.[75] At the end of the day, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali announced that ISIL controlled only 1 square kilometer of territory, and that all the people remaining there were ISIL militants and their families.[76][77] Meanwhile, SOHR reported that U.S. officials demanded ISIL surrender 40 tons of stolen gold the group possessed in exchange for safe-passage to an \"undisclosed location\" during alleged ongoing negotiations.[78]\n", "On 13 February, reports emerged that ISIL had executed more than 15 of its own fighters for attempting to surrender, seven of whom were French nationals. After clearing the Sheikh Hamad neighborhood, the SDF were able to break through ISIL defenses and capture the town center, forcing tens of ISIL jihadists to flee towards as-Safafinah with the rest of ISIL's militants held up at a nearby refugee camp near the town orchards.[79] The SDF reported receiving 425 civilians fleeing the pocket within the past 24 hours by truck and by foot; some of the fleeing women – many of them wives of ISIL fighters – had gunshot wounds, likely from ISIL forces shooting at their own fleeing wives in hopes of using their families as both human shields and bargaining chips during negotiations.[80][81] SDF and Coalition personnel singled out fleeing male civilians during processing and were reportedly using retinal scans, fingerprinting, and other biometric data gathering tools when screening them for jihadist ties. Meanwhile, the International Rescue Committee stated 51 people had died on the way from the enclave to the Al-Hawl refugee camp or shortly after arriving, most in the past few weeks. The majority were toddlers or newborn babies dying from hypothermia via long treks through the cold desert terrain with their relatives.[82]\n", "On 14 February, journalists reporting outside of the town said things were \"quiet\" on their end, as the pace of the SDF's advance had slowed. A few civilians came out overnight – the smallest batch in weeks – according to one aid worker on site. An SDF official said that clearing operations were continuing while the day's fighting mainly took place on the town's northeastern axis where he added that combatants were fielding new \"thermal weapons.\"[83] The SDF reported capturing a clinic used for treating ISIL troops and a weapons cache full of ammo, including 10 mortars, an artillery piece, and a car bomb rigged with explosives on the northeast axis. SDF fighters on the southeastern axis reportedly discovered the bodies of 26 ISIL troops late 14 February, including that of a child soldier.[84][85]\n", "Rainy weather, fleeing civilians, and ISIL ambush tactics continued to bog down SDF advances on 15 February as engineering teams conducted continuous tunnel clearing and de-mining operations on the northeastern axis.[86] Coalition surgical strikes were reportedly reduced to a maximum of two a day as Adnan Afrin, a Kurdish commander, said the SDF wanted to avoid \"causing a massacre\" due to ISIL bringing hundreds of civilian hostages out from underground tunnels in recent days. SOHR reported that a Coalition convoy of seven trucks, three ambulances and other vehicles headed towards the remaining ISIL-held area aiming to draw out the remaining jihadists and their families. At the end of the day, 200 ISIL fighters surrendered.[87][88][85]\n", "Speaking at the al-Omar oil field staging area on 16 February, SDF commander Jiya Furat stated that ISIL's remaining territory was reduced to \"700 square meters\",[note 1] and that a declaration of victory will be announced in \"days.\" Furat added that 10 previously captured SDF members were also released by ISIL as the terror group again demanded to be allowed to leave for Idlib.[89] The SOHR stated that the SDF was almost done asserting control, but residual ISIL fighters were hiding out in tunnel networks with hostages. Two Coalition airstrikes were also reported in the area. Civilian evacuations with minor front line skirmishes continued throughout to the 18th.[90]\n", "On 19 February, with ISIL's territory reduced to a small stretch of encircled hamlets composing a couple hundred square meters, the SDF affirmed their ultimatum to ISIL: surrender or die in battle. The SDF continued to operate cautiously as dozens of trucks evacuating civilians regularly streamed in and out of the region. The United Nations expressed concern over “the situation of some 200 families, including many women and children, who are reportedly trapped\" in the besieged ISIL enclave.[91] By nightfall, two Coalition airstrikes were reported in the area as many ISIL fighters seemed to have refused to surrender.[92]\n", "SDF officials stated on 20 February that they wanted to evacuate every civilian before storming the remaining \"120–300 ISIL fighters\", believed to be holed up at the Hawi al-Dandal hamlet area with \"at least 100 civilians\" present.[93] On 21 February, SOHR reported about 260 mostly foreign ISIL fighters remained encircled in the farmlands and in nearby tunnels, seemingly preferring to die fighting than surrender to the SDF.[94] The SDF predicted the last batch of civilians would be out of the area by the 21st, but no civilians were seen leaving during the day. Journalists reported seeing warplanes and U.S. attack helicopters scouting the area,[95] but no signs of combat. Meanwhile, French sources reported that the Coalition was verifying whether French jihadist Fabien Clain was killed in an airstrike the day prior that also left his brother Jean-Michel seriously wounded.[96] The Coalition confirmed Clain's death on 28 February.[97]\n", "The SDF said they were \"surprised\" at the number of civilians still being held in the enclave. Groups of civilians continued to flee in the direction of SDF forces, some escaping through tunnels and wrecked buildings. Human Rights Watch quoted interviewed civilians as saying that smugglers were charging 400 U.S. dollars per person. An SDF commander stated that it could take four to five more days before all civilians were completely out of the area of operations.[98]\n", "In the early hours of 26 February, another batch of ISIL fighters and their families surrendered to the SDF.[99] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for Syria stated 9,000 people had evacuated the enclave within the previous 72 hours, 99 percent of which were women and children. SOHR reported 1,400 people had evacuated the area since 24 February, including dozens of suspected ISIL militants. Recent Coalition airstrikes in the area focused mostly on pushing back ISIL fighters that blocked roads and escape routes in an effort to prevent civilian hostages from escaping in prior weeks.[100]\n", "The CJTF-OIR Coalition released a summary of its recent air and artillery operations in the area on 27 February. Between 10 February to 23 February, the Coalition conducted 186 strikes consisting of 426 engagements, including damaging or destroying: 285 ISIL tactical units,  189 fighting positions, 50 supply routes, 22 staging areas, 16 boats, 15 vehicles, six petroleum oil tankers, six aircraft operations areas, six VBIEDs, four command and control \"nodes\", three weapons caches, three heavy machine guns, three pieces of engineering equipment, two buildings, two tunnels, one cave, one IED production facility and one petroleum oil storage facility. The Coalition defines a \"strike\" as \"one or more kinetic engagements that occur in roughly the same geographic location to produce a single, sometimes cumulative effect in that location.\"[101]\n", "On 28 February, SDF spokesman Adnan Afrin announced discovery of a mass grave found 10 days ago in the town. It contained dozens of bodies, including of men and women while heads were also found in the grave. The SDF was trying to confirm whether they were Yazidis and Islamic State members. A video of Furat FM showed a mass-grave. The outlet's executive said that most of the bodies were apparently shot in the head. SDF spokeswoman Lilwa Abdulla confirmed they found large number of Yazidi bodies though there was no specific number.[102][103][104][105] Locals have however said the corpses were victims of airstrikes.[106]\n", "On 1 March, the Free Burma Rangers, one of the few aid groups in the area, said 15,000 people had fled the Baghuz area within the last month. At a screening center 20 kilometers away from Baghuz Fawqani, one Egyptian woman told reporters that ISIL was preventing men under 40 from quitting the redoubt, including her 27-year-old husband, in expectation of a final battle.[107][108] According to media reports, some of the evacuated ISIL brides still proclaimed loyalty to the Islamic State and its leader. Some even shouted jihadist slogans from the back of fleeing trucks. \"Abu Bakr Baghdadi will prevail,\" one woman said. \"We left because God created a reason to get out of here, but the Islamic State will always prevail. Abu Bakr Baghdadi is in the tunnels and they will bring victory.\" As reporters left, the woman and her children shouted, \"The Islamic State will remain!\"[109]\n", "At 6:00 pm local time (16:00 GMT) on 1 March, three weeks into the assault on Baghuz Fawqani, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali announced that the standoff with ISIL was over and that SDF units had began storming the remaining riverside encampments, which were a tent city said to be atop a network of caves and tunnels being used by the entrenched jihadists.[2] Bali expected a \"fierce\" battle as he said that the SDF resumed ground operations only after the evacuation of the last batch of civilians willing to leave and following the previous release of captured SDF fighters. \"The people we evacuated today told us that no civilians were inside and that those still inside did not want to leave,\" Bali stated. He added that SDF units would advance cautiously to avoid IEDs and land mines, and that any civilians encountered will be isolated though units will advance onward.[107]\n", "Reports of heavy fighting and increased Coalition air presence proliferated. Bali, who said he expected the battle to be over \"soon\", stated that the SDF were advancing on two fronts with their units fielding medium to heavy weapons. At least three SDF fighters were injured in overnight fighting.[110] By noon on 2 March, ISIL were deploying snipers, booby traps, drones, and \"thermal missiles\" against the SDF as U.S. helicopters circled the area. Black smoke occasionally filled the sky, apparently from airstrikes. An SDF spokesman, Zana Amedi, downplayed the SDF's dependence on air power in the assault due to jihadists using tunnels and human shields, saying “Now it’s mostly clashes. There are almost no airstrikes this morning. There were few airstrikes in the morning and nothing else after that.” Commander Adnan Afrin said the 1 kilometer buffer zone between front lines had been subsumed in the opening advance; he added that there had so far been no suicide attacks, though some land mines went off. He also stated that eight SDF personnel were wounded so far, some critically. The SOHR reported 10 ISIL fighters had been killed in recent clashes, adding that Syrian government forces and their allies clashed with ISIL militants that tried to infiltrate/escape cross to the west bank of the Euphrates river, which physically separates Syrian government and SDF territory; the engagement left seven jihadists dead.[1]\n", "ISIL began deploying VBIEDs using cars, motorbikes, and bicycles against SDF positions on the night of 2 March, several of which were subsequently destroyed by both Coalition air raids and SDF fighters using snipers and rockets; ISIL also shelled approaching ground forces.[111] An airstrike on an alleged ammunition depot set off a large explosion, causing a smouldering fire that led to continued secondary explosions into the next day, filling the sky with smoke. By the end of 2 March, SDF forces had made limited advances, capturing six tactical points and a hill overlooking the main ISIL camp.[112][113] By 3 March, the SDF reportedly had 160 machine gun units stationed at 50 meter intervals along the front line as sporadic gunfire and SDF mortars and artillery continued to shell the camp. With ISIL offering stiff resistance during the daytime, the SDF largely advanced and conducted closer-range combat after nightfall under the support of U.S. helicopters and warplanes; the dug-in jihadists were \"outgunned\" and did not have night vision, according to the SDF. The SDF had lost three fighters and had captured 13 to 14 points by the end of 3 March, according to a commander.[114][115][116] The SOHR cited local reports alleging that U.S. elements had deployed white phosphorus incendiary munitions in Baghuz; the deliberate use of the weapon in the presence of civilian areas is banned by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. A Coalition spokesman flatly denied the allegations.[117]\n", "Upon noticing the significant civilian presence still remaining in the area, the SDF again slowed down its general advance on 4 March. The move contradicted past statements that the assault wasn't going to begin until all civilians were out. \"We’re slowing down the offensive in Baghouz due to a small number of civilians held as human shields by Daesh,\" Mustafa Bali said. The SDF opened a secondary humanitarian corridor to facilitate evacuations.[118] Later in the day, SDF and Coalition officials stated that around 500 people, including 150 suspected ISIL militants, had surrendered, with 200 more expected to leave. The exact number of remaining ISIL fighters within the camp remained unknown; there were also continued concerns over just how extensive the underground tunnel networks were — some SDF fighters estimated that the tunnels extended for more than 2 kilometers.[119][117] Meanwhile, local reports claimed that ISIL commander Jamal Khaled Masoulkh was killed in an airstrike in Baghuz Fawqani the night before. He was the deputy commander of the Islamic State, stationed in Raqqa (ISIL's former de facto capital), before he moved to eastern Syria.[10]\n", "On 5 March, the SDF reported that 3,000 people had fled through the corridor since the slowdown on 4 March, with 10,000 people having fled in total since 10 February. One of the evacuees, Dorothee Maquere — the wife of deceased terrorist Fabien Clain — confirmed that his brother Jean-Michel Clain, who was critically injured from the Coalition airstrike on their position on 20 February, died on 3 March after an SDF mortar round landed near him. She also claimed that Hayat Boumeddiene, wanted by French authorities as a suspected accomplice in the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks, was killed in a separate strike during the prior week, which allegedly hit an ISIL safe house known as the \"French House,\" where many French nationals were staying. Other interviewed evacuees corroborated these claims, though they could not be independently verified at the time.[120] On 6 March, the SDF reported it had captured 400 ISIL militants overnight.[121]\n", "The standoff continued by 10 March, with ISIL flags still seen flying over the besieged encampment. SDF fighters, perched atop rooftops just hundreds of meters away from the camp, saw \"exhausted\"-looking ISIL militants, women and children milling about, yet to surrender even with dozens of evacuation trucks flowing in and out daily. The presence of the jihadists' civilian families continued to delay the SDF's attempts to clear the camp.[122][123] Later on the same day, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali stated that tens of thousands of people, including at least 4,000 ISIL fighters, had surrendered to the SDF within the past month. He also stated that no more civilians had left the ISIL enclave that day, and that SDF fighters did not see any further civilians within the ISIL pocket.[124]\n", "The second standoff came to an end on the afternoon of 10 March, with the SDF resuming the assault at 6:00 pm local time.[124] Heavy ground engagements, including machine gun fire and snipers, were reported. The SDF stated that warplanes and mortars were targeting weapons arsenals in the camp, which set sections of the camp ablaze.[125] On 11 March, ISIL fought back with suicide attacks — four jihadists assaulted SDF positions, setting off their explosive belts, though only succeeding in damaging a \"minesweeper,\" according to the SDF. 11 Coalition strikes were reported as SDF units fired on the camp from all sides with artillery, rocket barrages, and heavy weapons — they made limited advances, reportedly capturing an arms depot. Five SDF troops were wounded and one was killed, per the SDF. The SOHR reported that seven ISIL militants had been captured since 10 March.[126][127] Completely besieged in Baghuz Fawqani, ISIL released propaganda film and audio recordings via its few social media outlets late on 11 March desperately urging its supporters abroad to stage attacks against the \"Crusaders,\" a term used by jihadists to refer to western nations, and for followers to maintain their faith in God and the caliphate amidst complete territorial collapse.[128][129] Syrian state media, citing local sources, alleged that recent Coalition air raids had killed more than 50 civilians in the camp; this was not confirmed by the Coalition.[130]\n", "On 12 March, hundreds of people were seen surrendering to the SDF en masse, including fighters and their families. The SDF declared that the main battle was \"as good as over\" and they only needed to assert their control against resisting ISIL fighters holed up in complex tunnel networks in the area before declaring victory. They reported 25-38 ISIL militants had been killed since 10 March, while they themselves suffered three casualties. The Coalition had conducted around 20 airstrikes targeting weapons caches and command posts. Meanwhile, U.S. officials affirmed they did not believe any senior ISIL leaders remained in the area, assessing they had dispersed to other locations as part of the group's shift towards insurgency.[131][132] On 13 March, mortars and airstrikes continued to pound the camp as the SDF made limited advances on some points. ISIL took advantage of a dust storm to mount two counterattacks using suicide bombers; the first attack was repelled but the second attack was more successful, killing four SDF fighters and wounding eight others.[133][134] An SDF commander stated \"The objective of our advance is to terrorize ISIL fighters so they surrender, and for the civilians to come out.\" The SDF reported around 3,000 more people, including suspected jihadists, had fled the area since 11 March, a testament to just how densely populated the area remained and the inaccuracy of earlier estimates.[135]\n", "—Abu Abd al-Azim, ISIL fighter.[136] ISIL has promised its followers rewards in the afterlife for their service at Baghuz Fawqani.[137]\n", "On 14 March, heavy clashes resumed after 1,300 jihadists and their relatives surrendered during a lull in fighting, many of them being foreign nationals. The YPG, the SDF's spearheading fighting force, reported that ISIL had deployed more than 20 suicide bombers during counterattacks within the past two days, and that at least 112 ISIL fighters had been killed since 10 March.[138] On 17 March, the SDF released their figures on the operation since 9 January: 34,000 total civilians evacuated, 29,600 ISIL fighters and their family members surrendered, including more than 5,000 fighters, 1,306 ISIL militants killed, and 520 captured in operations. In turn, they put their casualties at 11 dead and 61 injured.[139]\n", "On 18 and 19 March, the SDF announced significant progress, capturing ISIL's encampment and taking hundreds of wounded, surrendering militants into custody. The camp was the biggest remaining area held by ISIL in Al-Baghuz Fawqani, itself the last populated area the militant group held.[140] SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali announced that the SDF had control of all of Al-Baghuz Fawqani, with the exception of a few pockets of resistance along the shores of the Euphrates river, where intermittent clashes continued with resisting ISIL fighters trapped between the captured camp and the river.[3] The SDF also stated that more than 5,000 people could still be remaining in the areas yet to be captured by the SDF, as the vast tunnel network in Baghuz Fawqani made it difficult to estimate the precise number of people hiding there.[3] Among the group that surrendered were suspects of the Manbij bombing that targeted U.S. soldiers in January 2019.[141]\n", "On 20 March, in response to the developments, U.S. President Donald Trump predicted that the remaining ISIL holdout would be cleared \"by tonight\" during a speech at a U.S. Army tank factory in the U.S. \"The caliphate is gone as of tonight,\" he said. Meanwhile, there were little signs of clashes in Baghuz Fawqani as Kurdish forces celebrated Newroz, the Kurdish new year, coupled with early celebrations of the battle concluding. An SDF official said that their forces were now largely searching tunnels of ISIL fighters as international journalists reported seeing ongoing evacuations of women and children in the camp.[142][143] The Baghuz area remained largely quiet on 21 March as cautious clearing operations against mines, booby traps, tunnels, and camouflaged trenches continued; SDF personnel notably boasted that ISIL's black standard flags, which \"instilled fear\" in the populace, no longer flew over the town. Anticipation of a pending declaration of victory over ISIL resulted in premature local and regional reports claiming the entirety of the area was cleared and that the SDF had declared victory. Both SDF and U.S. officials denied that the town was fully liberated and warned against premature declarations. \"We will continue fighting with our partners and allies, hunting ISIS wherever they may be,\" the Pentagon said, affirming that even after the declaration, ISIL as a group was not defeated and much of its leadership remained at-large.[144][145] Coalition airstrikes on two pockets of militants were reported late in the day. The YPG said some of the strikes targeted one group of fighters that had been pushed to the edge of the river and the rest were aimed at a second group which had taken cover by a mountain on the outskirts of the town. ISIL's Amaq News Agency also released footage, recorded inside the camp during the siege, mocking U.S. efforts to topple the \"caliphate\"; videos released by ISIL in recent weeks reportedly depicted women joining the male ISIL fighters in combat while defending the camp.[146]\n", "On 23 March, after weeks of civilian evacuations and fierce clashes with ISIL's most committed fighters, the SDF officially declared final victory over the Islamic State in Baghuz Fawqani, during a victory ceremony at the al-Omar oil field staging area, further north up the Euphrates River. Speaking at the ceremony, senior U.S. diplomat William Roebuck called the territorial defeat of the Islamic State a \"critical milestone\" that dealt a critical blow to the terror group, while also stressing that the group still remained a global security threat. At Baghuz Fawqani, journalists toured the war-torn ISIL encampment, with some describing it as a \"wasteland\" strewn with debris and stockpiles of unused mortars, rockets, and suicide vests; journalists noted that some corpses could still be seen and there was a faint smell of dead bodies in the air.[44]\n", "The SDF flag was raised over Baghuz Fawqani near the end of the battle, even as journalists reported mortars and gunfire near the cliff overlooking the camp, where airstrikes were reported during the previous day, as part of clean-up operations. Nevertheless, the battle concluded the SDF's multi-year Deir ez-Zor campaign and marked the territorial end of ISIL's self-declared \"caliphate\" that once ruled over as many as 8 million people and erased the borders between Iraq and Syria. ISIL's elusive leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remained unaccounted along with a number of foreign hostages who were presumed to be held in Baghuz Fawqani.[44]\n", "Both before and throughout the battle, immense focus was put on the surrounding humanitarian situation in the ISIL enclave. The SDF helped transfer tens of thousands of civilians to internally displaced persons camps in northeast Syria while also holding over 1,000 captured ISIL suspects and their family members as a result of their conquests. Both the SDF and the U.S. began urging international countries to repatriate the captured jihadists during the later stages of the battle.[147][148]\n", "On 21 February, an Iraqi official stated that the SDF had transferred 150 ISIL militants to Iraqi authorities under a deal involving a total of 502, making it the single largest repatriation of ISIL members thus far.[149] On 24 February, the Iraqi Government stated that they received 13 more ISIL suspects from the SDF. Some Iraqi officials stated that all 13 were of French origin.[100]\n", "By 1 March, the population of the Al-Hawl refugee camp soared past 50,000, due to the massive civilian evacuations from the Baghuz Fawqani region. Aid organizations feared that dysentery and other diseases could break out from the overflowing camp.[107] The United Nations stated that 84 people, mostly children, died on the way to Al-Hawl, since December 2018.[150][151] This number was raised to 100 by the end of the battle, and the refugee camp had swelled to at least 74,000 people.[44][152]\n", "On 7 March, in regards to the evacuations, CENTCOM commander Gen. Joseph Votel stated that he believed that surrendered ISIL fighters were largely \"unrepentant, unbroken and radicalized,\" and were waiting \"for the right time to resurge\". \"We will need to maintain a vigilant offensive against this now widely dispersed and disaggregated organization that includes leaders, fighters, facilitators, resources and toxic ideology,\" he added.[153] This was supported by subsequent interviews with surrendered ISIL militants and some of their family members. By 9 March, one month into the protracted battle/stand-off, many evacuating ISIL militants and their families reportedly remained unrepentant and devoted to the \"caliphate\" and hoped for future \"conquests\".[154]\n", "On 23 March, responding to the SDF's victory, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that \"a major danger to our country is now eliminated, yet the threat remains and the fight against terrorist groups must continue.\"[44] Hours after the battle, an NBC News crew vehicle in Syria was hit by an IED, killing the local driver but not harming the rest of the news team. It was not immediately clear whether it was targeted or unexploded ordnance.[155]\n"]}2  : {""=>"//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/", "Jump to navigation"=>"#mw-head", "Jump to

al-Dīmuqrāṭīya, Kurdish: Hêzên Sûriya Demokratîk‎, Classical Syriac: ܚܝ̈ܠܘܬܐ ܕܣܘܪܝܐ ܕܝܡܩܪܛܝܬܐ‎, translit. Ḥaylawotho d'Suriya Demoqraṭoyto), commonly abbreviated as SDF, HSD or QSD, is an alliance of Kurdish, Arab and Assyrian/Syriac militias, as well as some smaller Turkmen and Chechen participation,[114] in the Syrian Civil War.[115] The SDF is militarily led by the People's Protection Units (YPG), a mostly Kurdish militia.[116] Founded in October 2015, the SDF states its mission as fighting to create a secular, democratic and federal Syria.[citation needed] The updated December 2016 constitution of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) names the SDF as its official defence force.[117]\n", "The primary opponents of the SDF are the various Islamist and Arab nationalist rebel groups involved in the civil war, in particular the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Turkey-backed Syrian opposition groups, al-Qaeda affiliates, and their allies. The SDF has focused primarily on ISIL,[118] successfully driving them from important strategic areas, such as Al-Hawl, Shaddadi, Tishrin Dam, Manbij, al-Tabqah, Tabqa Dam, Baath Dam, and ISIL's former capital of Raqqa.[119][120][121][122][123][124] In March 2019 the SDF announced the total defeat of ISIS in Syria with the SDF taking control of the opponent's stronghold in Baghuz.[125]\n", "The establishment of the SDF was announced on 11 October 2015 during a press conference in al-Hasakah.[126] The alliance built on longstanding previous cooperation between the founding partners. While the People's Protection Units (Yekîneyên Parastina Gel, YPG) and the Women's Protection Units (Yekîneyên Parastina Jin, YPJ) had been operating throughout the regions of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, the other founding partners were more geographically focused.\n", "Geographically focused on Kobanî Canton were the YPG's partners in the Euphrates Volcano joint operations room, several mainstream Syrian rebel factions of the Free Syrian Army, who had helped defend the Kurdish town of Kobanî during the Siege of Kobanî. Liwa Thuwwar al-Raqqa was also in Euphrates Volcano, and it expelled by the al-Nusra Front and ISIL from the city of Raqqa for being allied with the YPG since April 2014. The group participated in the capture of Tell Abyad from the Islamic State.\n", "Geographically focused on Jazira Canton were the Assyrian Syriac Military Council (Mawtbo Fulhoyo Suryoyo, MFS) and the al-Sanadid Forces of the Arab Shammar tribe, both of whom had cooperated with the YPG in fighting ISIL since 2013.[127] The MFS is further politically aligned with the YPG via their shared secular ideology of democratic confederalism, which in the Assyrian community is known as the Dawronoye movement.[128]\n", "Geographically focused on the Shahba region was the Army of Revolutionaries (Jaysh al-Thuwar, JAT), itself an alliance of several groups of diverse ethnic and political backgrounds, who had in common that they had been rejected by the mainstream Syrian opposition for secular, anti-Islamist views and affiliations. However, most of the JAT component groups have always used the Free Syrian Army label and continue to use it.\n", "The following groups signed the founding document:[126]\n", "On 10 December 2015, after a two-day conference, The Syrian Democratic Council was established as a political platform of the SDF. Human rights activist Haytham Manna was co-chairman at its founding.[129] The Assembly that established the Syrian Democratic Council was made up of 13 members from specific ethnic, economic and political backgrounds.\n", "The Syrian Arab Coalition is claimed by the U.S. government as an alliance of programmatically exclusively ethnic Arab militias established during the Syrian Civil War. In this narrative, it consists of exclusively ethnic Arab component groups of the SDF alliance,[130][131] such as the al-Sanadid Forces, the Deir ez-Zor Military Council, Arab units within the Army of Revolutionaries, along with smaller factions.\n", "At the time of its founding in late 2015, The Economist described the SDF as \"essentially a subsidiary of the Kurdish YPG\".[132]\n", "With continuous growth in particular due to Arab groups and volunteers joining, in March 2016 only an estimated 60% of the men and women in the SDF fighting force were ethnic Kurds.[136] Growth in particular of Arab, Turkmen and Assyrian participation in the SDF has since continued. In an interview on the first anniversary of the SDF's founding, spokesman Talal Silo, an ethnic Turkmen and former commander of the Seljuq Brigade, stated that \"we started with 13 factions and now there are 32 factions\", and that \"90 percent\" of the SDF growth since it began its operations were ethnic Arabs.[137] In the context of the November 2016 Northern Raqqa offensive, The Economist claimed the SDF fighting force to be composed of \"about 20,000 YPG fighters and about 10,000 Arabs\".[138] The next month in December 2016, Colonel John Dorrian, the Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman, stated that the SDF contained around 45,000 fighters, of which more than 13,000 were Arabs.[139]\n", "According to a March 2017 statement of the Spokesman for the International Coalition forces, U.S. Colonel John Dorrian, 75 percent of the SDF forces fighting in Operation Wrath of Euphrates to isolate ISIL's de facto capital of Raqqa were Syrian Arabs, a reflection of the demographic composition of that area. \"The Syrian Democratic Forces are a multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian organization, and that is one of the reasons why we're working with them and they have continued to build the Arab element of their force.\"[158] Concerning the SDF in general, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend in the same month said that \"I'm seeing what is probably a pretty broad coalition of people and the Kurds may be providing the leadership, because they have a capable leader who's stepped up to this challenge. And they are providing some of the organisational skill, but I see a large contingent about 23 to 25, 000 so far and growing, Arabs, who are marching to liberate their part of northern Syria. So, I don't see a Kurdish state. I see a multi-cultural, multi-party, multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian Syrian region being liberated from ISIS. Over.\"[159]\n", "Late June, an analysis by the Counter Terrorism Center at West Point noted \"growing acceptance of the SDF by Sunni Arab rebel groups\" and more generally \"growing legitimacy of the SDF\".[157] Another analysis as of late June described the YPG as \"only one faction of many within the SDF\", however that \"it's the YPG that makes the SDF reliable and effective. The SDF's other components function as auxiliaries to the SDF's 'backbone', the YPG, which ensures effective, unitary command and control.\"[160]\n", "On 15 March 2017, a video surfaced that showed members of the Northern Sun Battalion allegedly torturing an ISIL fighter, who had been captured while planting mines. One of these mines had reportedly killed nine fighters of the battalion, leading five others to take revenge on the ISIL militant. The Manbij Military Council condemned the act, and announced that the involved Northern Sun Battalion fighters would be held for trial for violating the Geneva Conventions.[237][238] The five accused were arrested on 17 March.[239]\n", "In June 2015 the Turkish government alleged that the YPG was carrying out an ethnic cleansing as part of a plan to join the Jazira and Kobanî cantons into a single territory.[240]\n", "The U.S. State Department reacted by stating they would 'scrutinise' Amnesty International's accusations.[241] The U.S. State Department stated it had to determine if there was \"any veracity to the claims\", but showed concern by calling for any administrator in the area to rule \"with respect for all groups regardless of ethnicity\". The report makes accusations of looting, coercing civilians to join their armed forces and the forced targeted displacement of 1400 families in the Turkman villages of Hammam al-Turkman, 800 Turkmen from Mela Berho and Suluk residents. The report does not attempt to substantiate any of these claims with evidence other than supposed testimony from unnamed sources claiming to be alleged victims.[242]\n", "In a report published by the United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic on 10 March 2017, the Commission refuted Amnesty International's claims of ethnic cleansing, stating that \"'though allegations of 'ethnic cleansing' continued to be received during the period under review, the Commission found no evidence to substantiate claims that YPG or SDF forces ever targeted Arab communities on the basis of ethnicity.\"[243][244][245]\n", "In interviews, YPG spokespersons acknowledged that a number of families were in fact displaced. However, they placed the number at no more than 25,[246] and claimed military necessity. They stated that the family members of terrorists maintained communications with them, and therefore had to be removed from areas where they might pose a danger.[242] They further alleged that ISIL was using civilians in those areas to plant car bombs or carry out other attacks on the YPG.[242]\n", "In June 2014, Human Rights Watch criticized the YPG for accepting minors into their ranks,[247] picking up on multiple earlier reports of teenage fighters serving in the YPG, with a report by the United Nations Secretary General stating that 24 minors under age of 18 had been recruited by YPG, with 124 having been recruited by the Free Syrian Army and 5 by the Syrian Arab Army.[248] In response, the YPG and YPJ signed the Geneva Call Deed of Commitment protecting children in armed conflict, prohibiting sexual violence and against gender discrimination in July 2014,[249] and Kurdish security forces (YPG and Asayish) began receiving human rights training from Geneva Call and other international organisations with the YPG pledging publicly to demobilize all fighters under 18 within a month and began to enact disciplinary measures against commanders of the units that had involved in corruption and accepting recruit under age of 18 to their ranks.[250][251] In October 2015 the YPG demobilized 21 minors from the military service in its ranks.[252]\n", "In response to reports issued by international organisations such as Human Rights Watch,[253] the general command of the SDF issued a military order prohibiting the recruitment of children.[254]\n"]}3  :

A total of 78 people were killed and more than 600 injured.[4]\n", "The facility—located in Yancheng's industrial park—was operated by Tianjiayi Chemical (江苏天嘉宜化工有限公司), and was used to produce fertilizer[5] or pesticides.[6] Some sources reported that the plant produced organic chemicals, including some highly flammable compounds.[6] Tianjiayi Chemical had previously been penalized six times for infractions of pollution and waste management laws,[3] and China Daily reported fines over safety issues.[6]\n", "On November 27, 2007, an explosion occurred in one of the chemical factories in Chenjianggang Chemical Zone (陈家港生态化工园区), with 7 killed and many injured.[7][8] On November 23, 2010, more than thirty were poisoned by a toxic gas release.[9] On the morning of February 10, 2011, rumors of toxic chemical release and potential imminent explosions in the Chenjiagang Chemical Industry Park led to panic in the towns of Chenjiagang and Shuanggang, causing the death of four people.[10] On the afternoon of May 18 and again on July 26 in 2011, there were explosions at local factories.[11]\n", "The explosion occurred at a local time of 14:48[12][13] (06:48 GMT). It is reported to have killed 78 people,[1][2] and left at least 94 severely injured,[3] 32 of whom were critically injured.[6] Around 640 people required hospital treatment and were taken to 16 hospitals.[14][15][6] The injured included children at a local kindergarten.[6]  CENC detected an ML2.2 artificial earthquake whose epicenter is at 34°19′52″N 119°43′26″E﻿ / ﻿34.331°N 119.724°E﻿ / 34.331; 119.724.[13][16] \n", "The force of the blast started numerous fires in Yancheng, knocked down several buildings, and reportedly destroyed windows several kilometers away.[5] The fire was reported to have been controlled by 03:00 local time.[15] Considerable damage was caused to nearby factories and offices;[17] the roof of Henglida Chemical Factory, 3 km from the explosion, fell in.[15] At least one of the people killed was in another building destroyed by the blast.[3] Windows are reported to have been blown out up to 6 km away from the explosion, and houses and other buildings were damaged in the nearby village-level administrative divisions including Hai'an (Haianju) (海安社区) and Shadang (沙荡社区).[17]\n", "The search for survivors is continuing as of 23 March;[17] one survivor was rescued from the site on the morning of 23 March, but around 28 people remain missing.[3] According to the Jiangsu environmental protection bureau, the monitored levels of benzene, toluene, and xylene in the area were not abnormal, and levels of acetone and chloroform outside the explosion area were within normal limits.[6]\n", "The precise cause of the explosion is not yet known.[3][15] There were no reports of anything abnormal at the plant before the explosion.[15] A worker at the plant has reported the cause as a fire in a natural gas tanker that spread to benzol storage tank,[17] but this has not been confirmed.\n"]}4  : {""=>"//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/", "Jump to navigation"=>"#mw-head", "Jump to search"=>"#p-search",

administration of Yancheng, Jiangsu province, China. The northernmost county-level division of Yancheng, it borders the prefecture-level cities of Lianyungang to the northwest and Huai'an to the southwest. The county was founded in 1966, and has a population of around 600,000. The county has 15 township-level divisions.\n", "There are 12 towns are under the jurisdiction of Xiangshui County and they are:\n", "On its northern territory, the Guanhe River, an inner river of Jiangsu, flows through from west to east until running into the Yellow Sea. The county owns 43 km of the coastal line, facing Japan and Korea by crossing the sea. Stunning local residents over years, tens of False Killer Whales from the Yellow Sea had swum back into its watergate as deep as 10 km. Covered by abundance of an aquatic plant species, shallow water lotus, the county is honored as a “Town of Shallow Water Lotus”.\n", "Principal natural resources include its marine area and marshland. The county is currently the largest site for sea salt production in China.\n", "Xiangshui county has an oceanic monsoon climate with humid changeable wind and distinct four seasons. The average temperature is 14°C with the hottest 38.7°C in July and the coldest -17°C in January. The raining season is from the middle of June to July and the average annual precipitation is 1,000 mm. There are 209 days free of frost.\n", "Xiangshui’s road transportation mainly relies on G204, S307, Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Expressway and the Jiangsu Coastline Expressway, in which G204 and S307 run through the county from east to west but Jinghu and Coastline Expressway go the north-south direction. Its water transportation relies on two major rivers, the Tongyu Canal and Guanhe River. Chengjiagang Port, located at the mouth of Guanhe rive, opens to international cargo transportation. The port is 36 km (22 mi) away from Lianyungang Port.\n", "Air travellers are serviced by the Yancheng Nanyang International Airport, and Huai'an Lianshui Airport.\n", "Xiangshui was traditionally a poor county, and was a testing ground for Jiangsu's economic reform policies. Its 2018 GDP was around 34.5 billion yuan, or a per capita GDP of approximately $8,300, low by Jiangsu standards. By 2018, it had joined the ranks of the \"top one hundred counties for investment potential\", signalling its more recent economic growth.[2]\n", "Xiangshui was a traditional salt-making site but now it is an important agricultural land. The agricultural income occupies 30% of the county revenue. Principal agricultural products include rice, cotton, fruit, livestock and vegetable. In addition, aquatic production has earned the county a national reputation with more than 200 sea food products including fish, crab, shrimp, etc.\nThe county’s industrial sectors are still in its early shape, including textile, chemicals, machinery, food manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.\n", "Before 2000, Xiangshui is an agricultural land with uncontaminated environment and it still owns a well shaped ecosystem. However, due to more strict regulations in the more prosperous southern parts of Jiangsu province, chemical plants began moving to the relatively poor northern Jiangsu region. These chemical factories usually enjoyed the preferential treatment from the local Xiangshui government. Lacking or without strict regulation and supervision, these chemical plants brought pollution and environmental damage to the county. On November 27, 2007, an explosion occurred in one of the chemical factories in Chenjianggang Chemical Zone, with 7 killed and many injured. On March 21, 2019, a major explosion occurred at a chemical plant in Chenjiagang Town. A total of 64 people were killed and more than 600 injured.\n"]}
